[About {{< iconify cib:about-me >}}]{style="font-size: 2.5rem;"}

I was born and raised in Japan, lived both in Mainland China and Taiwan for some time, and I am currently studying in Hamburg. So I speak Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, German and English ðŸ˜‰ feel free to write to me in any of these! It's okay to call me a Chinese or Taiwanese, because I am both. But please don't discuss politics with me, because I still have family living in Mainland China ðŸ«¢.

I am a M.Sc. Biology Student at University of Hamburg. I specialized in molecular lab technics and am now pivoting into interdisciplinary evolution and ecology research. I love doing lab works but I love field works a bit more, and I am trying my best to find a balance between both. 

I am interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of various ecosystems and organisms. I am currently involved in two projects relating to my bachelor thesis about *Wolbachia*-infected, female-biased beetles *Altica lythri*. And my (upcoming) master thesis (still in the exploring stage).

## {{< iconify ph:film-reel >}} Hobby

I take a lot of photos, simply to treasure the moments that I enjoyed and loved. I don't limit myself in certain technics or topics - I shoot both analog and digital, still and motion picture, I once tried cyanotype too, and would love to start again. I shoot wonderful nature, starlight, but also urban landscapes, people, or small things in life. 

I use photography as a way to express myself. People say the world is as one sees it. I haven't experienced excessive grief, but I've certainly seen enough. So when I create something back for the world, I want them to be something less hurting. New media has massively promoted the hatred-misery-pandemic, but I choose to break the cycle. 

[Here](/gallery/gallery.qmd) you can see all my albums and [here](/gallery/motion-pictures.qmd) are some picked motion pictures. Also check [here](/gallery/blue-marble/blue-marble.qmd) for star / astro topics.

I also use this website to share my knowledge, many of them are basically refined version of my own notes. I do this because I've been helped by posts on the internet from others multiple times, and I don't want this kindness to stop with me. I also value all kind of suggestions and comments.

I use R for my GIS work (I have trust issue with Q-GIS).
