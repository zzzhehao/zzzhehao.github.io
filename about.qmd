[About {{< iconify cib:about-me >}}]{style="font-size: 2.5rem;"}

I was born and raised in Japan, lived both in Mainland China and Taiwan for some time, and I am currently studying in Hamburg. So I speak Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, German and English ðŸ˜‰ feel free to write to me in any of these! 

I am a M.Sc. Biology Student at University of Hamburg. I have received my B.Sc. degree with focus on molecular ecology and am now pivoting into interdisciplinary evolution and ecology research. I love doing lab works but I love field works a bit more; I have interest in new technologies but I am more interested in biological process happening out there in the wild. I am trying my best to find a balance among all these.

In particular I am interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of various ecosystems and organisms in terms of adaptation and biogeography. I am currently involved in three projects:

## [Feminized beetles *Altica lythri* with reproductive master manipulator *Wolbachia*]{.cl-title}

All have started with a wild sex ratio distortion only associated with certain mitochondrial haplotypes of a polyphyletic flea beetle species *Altica lythri* with introgression history. Previous work has observed strong correlation between presence of sex ratio distortion, certain mitochondrial haplotypes, and single *Wolbahcia* strains. We could then confirm an active feminization during the reproduction, now there's the question - is this another master piece of the evolutionary most stunning bacteria *Wolbachia*? We have observed a shift in *Wolbachia* community composition among the haplotypes and the mystery still awaits to be unraveled. 

This was part of my bachelor thesis and we are now expanding the scale of dataset aiming for publication.

## [Integrative Taxonomy of *Acanthocope* Beddard, 1885 (Isopoda: Munnopsidae)]{.cl-title}

*Acanthocope* Beddard 1885 is a deep-sea isopod genus, with characteristic spiky body. Despite the gifted swimming ability as a munnopsid isopod, *Acanthocope* has shown so far quite high rate of endemism in their distribution, this is of course to be attributed to under-researched situation of the deep-sea. Recently, in one and the only cosmopolitan species *Acanthocope galatheae* Wolff 1962, active gene flow across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was confirmed. I am reporting additional observation, genetic and proteomics data from multiple species in Northern Atlantic, to examine the current morphology-based taxonomy of this genus. 

I have adopted this project as a project-based internship and am now striving to publish the result.

## [Ocean Census GoSouth: Searching for New Species in the South Sandwich Islands]{.cl-title}

It is an honor, and also a privilege to sail with Schmidt Ocean Institute's state-of-the-art research Vessel R/V *Falkor (too)*, as an Ocean Census taxonomist, towards one of the world's most remote place - South Sandwich Island. 

Focusing on using ROV *SuBastian*, we seek to search for new species that the mankind has never seen before, and contribute to the overall knowledge of our mysterious Ocean.

You can find more details on the [expedition website](https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/searching-for-new-species-in-the-south-sandwich-islands-2/), and also my stories in [my blog](/project/fkt250220/index.qmd).

I also use this website to share my knowledge, many of them are basically refined version of my own notes. I do this because I've been helped by posts on the internet from others multiple times, and I don't want this kindness to stop with me. I also value all kind of suggestions and comments.

## {{< iconify ph:film-reel >}} Hobby

I take a lot of photos, simply to treasure the moments that I enjoyed and loved. I don't limit myself in certain technics or topics - I shoot both analog and digital, still and motion picture, I once tried cyanotype too, and would love to start again. I shoot wonderful nature, starlight, but also urban landscapes, people, or small things in life. 

I use photography as a way to express myself. People say the world is as one sees it. I haven't experienced excessive grief, but I've certainly seen enough. So when I create something back for the world, I want them to be something less hurting. 
<!-- New media has massively promoted the hatred-misery-pandemic, but I choose to break the cycle.  -->

[Here](/gallery/gallery.qmd) you can see all my albums and [here](/gallery/motion-pictures.qmd) are some picked motion pictures. Also check [here](/gallery/blue-marble/blue-marble.qmd) for star / astro topics.

That being said, if human had the ability to explore the deep space physically, I will definitely go off-world.

<!-- ## {{< iconify pajamas:lock-open >}} Open Science

Science should be open to everyone, regardless of whatever people use to categorize others. I recently shared my notes on *Evolutionary Systematics* and would appreciate any contribution from fellow open-minded scientists. The goal is to compile introductions to various related topics in one place and serve as a signpost for those who wants to start in the field.
