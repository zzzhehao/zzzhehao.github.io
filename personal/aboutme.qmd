# About Me

👋 Hi, I am Zhehao.

If you are wondering how to speak my name, it's 'dʒe hao', as 哲豪 written in Chinese. I was born in Japan but technically I am a Taiwanese citizen, I spent my first six years in Tokyo [(東京)](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6732346,139.7532873,11.45z?entry=ttu)
near Tamagawa (Tama-River) [(多摩川)](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6223228,139.5730771,14.62z?entry=ttu)
- which separate the capital and the neighboring district Kanagawa-Ken (神奈川県) is separated. I then went to school in Kunshan [(昆山)](https://www.google.com/maps/@31.3803707,120.9563431,14.08z?entry=ttu)
, a small city neighbouring Shanghai [(上海)](https://www.google.com/maps/@31.1458601,121.2870183,9.81z?entry=ttu)
until 2016, since then I went to high school in [Schwerin (Germany, MV)](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.6647976,11.447494,11.51z?entry=ttu) 
and started my degree program in [Hamburg](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.5526666,9.9925612,12.29z?entry=ttu) since 2020. Recently I am more often staying in Kaohsiung [(高雄)](https://www.google.com/maps/@22.6578342,120.3375094,11.71z?entry=ttu) 
when I spend time with my folks. 

## What I study

At this point I have finished my B.Sc. in Biology and am currently pursuing my M.Sc degree. I have specialized myself in molecular biology, ecolutionary ecology, and bioinformatics through various experiences. But I am also interested in many other fields in general, such as microbiology, immunology, biotechnology that involves bioimaging, animal physiology, especially the adaptation of marine species, and I aim to combine my interests with my strength to contribute the research in a interdisciplinary way.

## What I do in free time

Taking photos is one of my major hobby in personal life.
