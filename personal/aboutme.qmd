üëã Hi, I am Zhehao.

If you are wondering how to speak my name, it's like 'd íe hao', as Âì≤Ë±™ written in Chinese. I was born in Japan but technically I am a Taiwanese citizen, I spent my first six years in Tokyo [(Êù±‰∫¨)](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6732346,139.7532873,11.45z?entry=ttu)
near Tamagawa (Tama-River) [(Â§öÊë©Â∑ù)](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6223228,139.5730771,14.62z?entry=ttu). Then I move to Kunshan [(ÊòÜÂ±±)](https://www.google.com/maps/@31.3803707,120.9563431,14.08z?entry=ttu)
, a small city near Shanghai [(‰∏äÊµ∑)](https://www.google.com/maps/@31.1458601,121.2870183,9.81z?entry=ttu), for school. Since 2016, I went to high school in [Schwerin (Germany, MV)](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.6647976,11.447494,11.51z?entry=ttu) 
and started my degree program in [Hamburg](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.5526666,9.9925612,12.29z?entry=ttu) in 2020. Recently I am more often staying in Kaohsiung [(È´òÈõÑ)](https://www.google.com/maps/@22.6578342,120.3375094,11.71z?entry=ttu) 
when I spend time with my folks. 

## What I study

At this point I have finished my B.Sc. in Biology and am currently pursuing my M.Sc degree. I have specialized myself in molecular biology, ecolutionary ecology, and biostatistics through various experiences. But I am also interested in many other fields in general, such as microbiology, immunology, biotechnology, animal physiology, especially the adaptation of marine species, and I aim to combine my interests with my strength to contribute the research in a interdisciplinary way.

You can find more detailed introduction of me as a biology student [here](/research/asbiologist.qmd).

## What I do in free time

### Photography

Photography is one of my major hobby in personal life. 

### Coffee

### Coding

### Coding & Coffee

I also drink coffee virtually.

```{r}
library(kitchen)

Cappuccino <- function(coffee, type) {
  if (type == "whole") {
    coffee <- grind(coffee, size = extra_fine)
  }
  
  espresso <- Moka.pot(coffee, size = 2, heat_level = medium, min = 5)
  foam <- froth(milk)
  milk <- steam(milk)
  cappuccino <- latte.art(espresso, foam, milk)
  
  return(cappuccino)
}

Coffee <- Cappuccino(Okinawa_Sango_Roast, "whole")
Sip(Coffee)
```

Okay that's enough.

### Hiking

### Diving
