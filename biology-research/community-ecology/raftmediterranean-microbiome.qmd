## Mediterranean Microbiome

## Miscellaneous

I worked with *Wolbachia* in my bachelor thesis - everyone who knows them should be aware of their incredible evolution. I searched for *Wolbachia* out of curious in the dataset, and found an entry in [`Prok_taxadata.txt`](https://github.com/InaMariaDeutschmann/GlobalNetworkMalaspinaHotmix/blob/main/00_Tables/Prok_taxdata.txt).

No comments on this since there's no entry in quality-controlled ASV dataset. But after I read the paper [@parvathi2020] that found *Wolbachia sp* being most abundant in deep-sea sediment microbial community, I would literally not be surprised anymore if people found *Wolbachia* being most dominant in the aerosol as next. Too wild.

By the way,
