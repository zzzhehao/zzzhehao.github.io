This is a simplified instroduction of my bachelor thesis, a part of the research project conducted by the research group [*Molecular Evolutionary Biology*](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/evolutionsbiologie/molevolbio.html) at University of Hamburg, led by **Prof. Dr. Susanne Dobler**. **Dr. Kim Rohlfing** designed the experiment and supervised me while conducting the experiment and analysing the data.

## *Wolbachia*: the females shall rise

Regardless of which sex determination system is present, a balanced ratio of 1:1 is expected from both sexes [@hamilton1967]. However, it is not rare in the nature that this equilibrium is interrupted by various factors, such as reproduction manipulative bacteria *Wolbachia*.

*Wolbachia* belongs to the Rickettsiales (Alphaproteobacteria) [@oneill1992; @boone2001], it was first described by @hertig1924 in common house mosquito *Culex pipiens* as a Rickettsia-like bacteria, and later named after one of the discover Wolbach as *Wolbachia pipientis* [@hertig1936]. The group Alphaproteobacteria has a very close relation to mitochondria, the power factory in our cells, thus the *Wolbachia* is similarily a intracellular bacteria [@zhou1998].

Given its inability to live outside the host cell, the *Wolbachia* is supposed to be transmitted along the maternal line, like the mitochondria, since male hosts are dead end for *Wolbachia*. Also becasue of this, *Wolbachia* are found most prevalent inside the reproduction tissue of their hosts (testes, ovaries). People have observed a rising number of cases, in which *Wolbachia* is associated with female-biased sex ratio of the host species - and it is understandable as it can be considered as the biggest interest of *Wolbachia* [@werren1997]. There are several strategies that *Wolbachia* usually uses to accomplish such purpose (@fig-wol-phenotype): the feminization (FI), the parthenogenesis (PI), the male-killing (MK), and the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI is the most common type but I won't elaborate too much on it since it alone does not induce a sex-bias towards female [@werren2008].

These acitve munipulation of the host reproduction has given *Wolbachia* huge advantages. They have to date established a world-wide, possibly the biggest pandemic in the history of life. Arthropods and filarial nematodes are the main groups of their hosts, yet the phenomena caused by *Wolbachia* can be extremely different from host to host. In filarial nematodes, they have become an obligate mutualistic bacteria, but in arthropods, most of them are parasitic. 

## The shinny bittle *Altica lythri*

Like many other arthropod, *Altica lythri* also hosts this bacteria, but it's a bit more complex with *A. lythri* here. First of all, this beetle species is not monophyletic [@jackel2013]. Previous study found an inconsistency between nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, which suggests that this species has experienced hybridization and introgression in its evolution. 

As mentioned before, *Wolbachia* should follow the same inheritance pattern as the mitochondria, a strong correlation between different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and *Wolbachia* strains was observed: HT1 - *w*LytA1 / HT1* - uninfected / HT2 - *w*LytA2 / HT3 - *w*LytB. Yet during the subsequent studies, some ddRAD-seq reads from pooled HT1* samples were mapped to *Wolbachia* reference genome (Zeng, unpublished). This rose the question: **Are the HT1\* individuals really immune to _Wolbachia_, or are they just low-level infected and were never detected by previous genotyping technique?**

## Updated status of the pandemic

Previously, the infection was confirmed by normal PCR and gel-electrophoresis. Now with a demand on better detectability and additional quantitative information, we designed a new qPCR protocol to test for infection. The result yielded several changes since the last comprehensive survey.
