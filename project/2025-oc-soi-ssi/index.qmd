## The Mission

We are going to South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica. The expedition is organized by Ocean Census and Schmidt Ocean Institute, sailing with SOI's R/V Falkor (Too). 

## Public Engagement

- SOI will stream the live video transmitted from ROV on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SchmidtOcean). Replay from other expeditions are also available. 
- Ocean Census, SOI, GoSouth will conduct a joint campaign on the social media. Follow them there!
