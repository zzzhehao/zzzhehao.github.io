So I speak Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, German and English ðŸ˜‰ feel free to write to me in any of these! It's okay to call me a Chinese or Taiwanese, because I am both. But please don't discuss politics with me, because I still have family living in Mainland China ðŸ«¢.\n\nI am a M.Sc. Biology Student at University of Hamburg. I specialized in molecular lab technics and am now pivoting into interdisciplinary evolution and ecology research. I love doing lab works but I love field works a bit more, and I am trying my best to find a balance between both. \n\nI am interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of various ecosystems and organisms. I am currently involved in two projects relating to my bachelor thesis about *Wolbachia*-infected, female-biased beetles *Altica lythri*. And my (upcoming) master thesis (still in the exploring stage).\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.5rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## [*Wolbachia* - *Altica lythri* related publications]{.cl-sub}\n\n- JÃ¤ckel et al.

I don't limit myself in certain technics or topics - I shoot both analog and digital, still and motion picture, I once tried cyanotype too, and would love to start again. I shoot wonderful nature, starlight, but also urban landscapes, people, or small things in life. \n\nI use photography as a way to express myself. People say the world is as one sees it. I haven't experienced excessive grief, but I've certainly seen enough. So when I create something back for the world, I want them to be something less hurting. New media has massively promoted the hatred-misery-pandemic, but I choose to break the cycle. \n\n[Here](/gallery/gallery.qmd) you can see all my albums and [here](/gallery/motion-pictures.qmd) are some picked motion pictures. Also check [here](/gallery/blue-marble/blue-marble.qmd) for star / astro topics.\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- ```{r}\n#| output: asis\n#| echo: false\n\nfiles <- list.files(path = 'assets/gallery/album', recursive = T, full.names = T)\n\nset.seed(as.numeric(today()))\npick <- round(runif(n = 1, max = length(files)), digit = 0)\nfile <- files[pick]\nfile.name <- basename(file) %>% sub(\"\\\\.jpg$\", \"\", .)\nurl <- paste0('https://zzzhehao.github.io/', file)\n\ncat(\n    \"::: {.name-title style=\\\"font-size: 1.5rem\\\"}\nToday's Pick\", \"\\n\", \":::\", \"\\n\",\n\n    \"::: {.image-container}\", \"\\n\",\n    \"::: {.pick-image}\", \"\\n\",\n    \"[![](\", url, ')](', \"https://zzzhehao.github.io/gallery/gallery.html#\", file.name, ')', \"\\n\", \n    \":::\", \"\\n\", \":::\",\n    sep = \"\")\n``` -->\n\n<div id=\"daily-photo\"></div>\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< iconify streamline:hand-held-tablet-writing >}} Posts\n\nI also use this website to share my knowledge, many of them are basically refined version of my own notes. I do this because I've been helped by posts on the internet from others multiple times, and I don't want this kindness to stop with me. I also value all kind of suggestions and comments.\n\n::: {#ls-all}\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify material-symbols:fact-check-outline-rounded >}} Fun Facts\n\nI use R for my GIS work (I have trust issue with Q-GIS).\n",
