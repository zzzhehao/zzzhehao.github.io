So I speak Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, German and English ðŸ˜‰ feel free to write to me in any of these! \n\nI am a M.Sc. Biology Student at University of Hamburg. I specialized in molecular lab technics and am now pivoting into interdisciplinary evolution and ecology research. I love doing lab works but I love field works a bit more, and I am trying my best to find a balance between both. \n\nI am interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of various ecosystems and organisms. I am currently involved in two projects relating to my bachelor thesis about *Wolbachia*-infected, female-biased beetles *Altica lythri*. And my (upcoming) master thesis (still in the exploring stage).\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.5rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## [*Wolbachia* - *Altica lythri* related publications]{.cl-sub}\n\n- JÃ¤ckel et al. [Evidence for Selective Sweeps by Wolbachia Infections: Phylogeny of Altica Leaf Beetles and Their Reproductive Parasites](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.12389), 2013.\n- Rohlfing et al.

I don't limit myself in certain technics or topics - I shoot both analog and digital, still and motion picture, I once tried cyanotype too, and would love to start again. I shoot wonderful nature, starlight, but also urban landscapes, people, or small things in life. \n\nI use photography as a way to express myself. People say the world is as one sees it. I haven't experienced excessive grief, but I've certainly seen enough. So when I create something back for the world, I want them to be something less hurting. New media has massively promoted the hatred-misery-pandemic, but I choose to break the cycle. \n\n[Here](/gallery/gallery.qmd) you can see all my albums and [here](/gallery/motion-pictures.qmd) are some picked motion pictures. Also check [here](/gallery/blue-marble/blue-marble.qmd) for star / astro topics.\n\n<br>\n\n<div id=\"daily-photo\"></div>\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< iconify streamline:hand-held-tablet-writing >}} Posts\n\nI also use this website to share my knowledge, many of them are basically refined version of my own notes. I do this because I've been helped by posts on the internet from others multiple times, and I don't want this kindness to stop with me. I also value all kind of suggestions and comments.\n\n::: {#ls-all}\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify pajamas:lock-open >}} Open Science\n\nScience should be open to everyone, regardless of whatever people use to categorize others. I recently shared my notes on *Evolutionary Systematics* and would appreciate any contribution from fellow open-minded scientists. The goal is to compile introductions to various related topics in one place and serve as a signpost for those who wants to start in the field.\n\nNote repo for open science and for everyone: [zzzhehao/EvoSys](https://github.com/zzzhehao/EvoSys).\n\n## {{< iconify material-symbols:fact-check-outline-rounded >}} Random Facts\n\n- Avocado in sushi is to me what pineapple on pizza is to Italians. \n- If I have to choose between avocado sushi and working with Q-GIS, I'm gonnna choose avocado sushi ultra max. \n- I am hopelessly spontaneous. I once planned to go to the library but then ended up doing some gardening with professors and fellows the whole afternoon and got nothing done for my plan. (Gardening is important!)\n\n![Someone's enjoying](/assets/images/gardening.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n- I am also hopelessly nosy, literally an intel black hole.\n- I dive. \n",
