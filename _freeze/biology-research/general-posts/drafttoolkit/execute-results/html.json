It's therefore crucial to have a consistent and well-crafted system throughout the entire lifecycle to keep things organized and secure. You will not want to mess with references at the end of your writing and find your data lost at the same time.\n\nOn the internet, there's a lot of different setup and workflow using similar tools as I will show here, the things is to find the best suiting one for yourself and master the tools to get things done more efficiently and safely. So I will focus a lot more on **why** I am doing things my way, rather than just flush you with **how** exactly I use every fancy tool and let you just copy it. It will bring nothing to you and stop working as soon as something changes. Everyone should find their own best way.\n\n## Connections is the key of a project\n\nThe biggest problem I saw and experienced with many workflows, is that people are not properly utilizing the automation capability of the tools we have nowadays. \n\nEarly days when people don't use computers to write, what we write on a paper stays exactly on that particular piece of paper. But researching requires a lot of rearranging of the existing idea and knowledge, managing fluid information and on-going project. This results in combination and linking among information we have, with what the computer system is really good at helping us. You might already heard of concepts like \"Zettelkasten\", or \"Atomic note\", both emphasize the method of combining existing knowledges to unravel unknown. Our brain understands new things with the knowledge we already have, that is, if we imaging our knowledge as a network consists of node and connections between nodes, adding new nodes at outer edge of the network and trying to connect them with the existing network. The connectideness secures the new acquired information and gives birth to more novel nodes. \n\n![Obsidian Grarph demonstrates how links between my files enhances the note structure. Every node represents a single file and different colors means different functional role or topic.](/biology-research/general-posts/assets/obsidian_graphs.gif){.curved}\n\nAnd this connection concept leads to my second non-negotiable rule, I call it **Original-alias reference** system, which says simply that one information should only have one entity, and subsequent work refering it (analyze, comment, mention, whatever) should go through its aliases. This will keep things tidy and non-redundant. \n\nThe absolute popular alternative to this is just copying the information, which breaks both rules at the same time - it's not linked with each other anymore, and it's redundant. Imaging we acquired a raw data from an experiment, which is used for multiple purposes, so we copied it to all the locations where it is needed. But later we decided to annotate the result, then we have to re-copy it to all the locations, again. And there, my friend, is where things start getting messy. If we keep doing this way, we will lose track on everything in no time and there's no way to recover.\n\nIt might sound ridiculous, but I have actually seen it as an SOP.\n\nThe most suitable tool for such task is no doubt Markdown, technically, Markdown is not a tool, but a mark-up language, which is so simple but powerful, that makes itself the best candidate for semi-technical writing. The golden standard of technical writing is certainly the most powerful \\LaTeX, but we won't use many of its features in daily life and there's quite a steep learning curve for that. For everyone who hasn't heard Markdown yet, it's a breeze to learn [its syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), if there's any. It's based on plain text, but allows you to format the text with most features one would need in daily writing (seriously, get rid of MS Word, please).\n\nAmong all editors and readers of Markdown, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is no doubt the most secure, clean and powerful tool on the market, reason is very much lying on the mission of Obsidian itself [as stated by its current CEO](https://x.com/kepano/status/1622648628379787264):\n\n1. Free for personal use\n2. Build on durable open file formats, no registration required\n3. Private, offline-first\n4. Endlessly customizable via API/plugins\n\nAnd I say at the current point as writing, Obsidian has been exactly as they stated to be.\n\n![Obsidian](/biology-research/general-posts/assets/obsidian-icon.png){.curved style=\"width:40%;\"}\n\nI used to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so), which is absolute great alternative for constructing team documents or other interactive stuffs, but since it's completely online based on their server, there is always a concern for sensitive informations and data security, and it's still a bit inconvenient for people who does not use Notion regularly to require extra registration.\n\nThe most crucial one here is the file linking. \n\n`[title](link/to/the/file)`\n\nThe link in round bracket could be literally any file, \n\nA node without any connections is called orphan, and we want to prevent that. So everytime when you create a new note, be sure that it is connected with something related. \n\n",
