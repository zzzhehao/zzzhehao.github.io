This idea and goal basically drove my decision for my entire bachelor program. I applied for neurophysiology class twice during bachelor, got rejected both time because I wasn't lucky enough to get a spot (or am I lucky?). I tried applying for another three courses in master too (basically all neuroscience course we can apply for). I even put them at my first three priorities, got rejected from all of them again, because of lack of spot. Instead, I got my 5th course *Evolutionary Systematics*, and my last (9th I think) wish, which is *Marine Benthic Habitat and Biodiversity*. \n\nYou might found this a bit inconsistent with my previous journal, but that one was written after all this incidents, so the story here actually predates writing that post.\n\nInteresting thing, there was an opening week for new students when the first master's semester began, where all the working groups from the university make a short presentation about their research and course they provide. I was back at Hamburg from Taiwan a week earlier and received a warm (40ºC) welcome by the influenza and couldn't even think rationally. But it turned out I missed nothing because the working group who offer the Marine course was forgotten by our administrative office (I will elaborate on that in bit more detail later). I discovered the course on our program manual and simply applied to fill out my priority list. Ironically, I started working in the working group who offer the Neurophysiology course since this summer. It's a student job to assist genotyping mice which they use for animal experiments, and the staffs were so nice and offered me an internal referral to get into the course they provide. But I was already fully scheduled so I didn't take that offer.\n\n<figure><img src=https://preview.redd.it/hq2ronx4juvz.jpg?auto=webp&s=dea66001de19b6191aeba4f8cc536fa63d4c510f></figure>\n\nAnd what I was busy taking care of, was ironically again, derived from the 9th course. \n\n## The course\n\nThe course was cold \"Marine Deep-Sea Benthic Habitats and Diversity\", led by Prof. Dr. Saskia Brix and Dr. Anne-Nina Lörz. To be honest, I had a bit \n\n## Internship\n\n## At Wilhelmshaven\n\n## Next Step\n\nI was lucky enough - on the day I received a rejection for an expedition in next January, my supervisor passed me another berth offer came from Ocean Census.\n\nYes, I will be sailing with them along with Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel R/V Falkor (too) towards South Sandwich Island. \n\nThat's why I changed my github profile image to:\n\n![](assets/Pingu.JPG){width=\"30%\"}\n\nBasically, randomness and unpredictability is what drives our path. The only certainty in life is the uncertainty.",
