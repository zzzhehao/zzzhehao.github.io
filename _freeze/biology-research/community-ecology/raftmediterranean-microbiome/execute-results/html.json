Biology module *Network Analysis in Ecology and Beyong* offered by [Prof. Dr. Jochen Fr√ºnd](https://jochenfruend.wordpress.com) at [University of Hamburg](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/en.html). A digital version of the poster for final presentation is available [here]().\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## [R Setup]{.cl-sub}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(bipartite)\nlibrary(igraph)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n## Mediterranean Microbiome\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nI worked with *Wolbachia* in my bachelor thesis - everyone who knows them should be aware of their incredible evolution. I searched for *Wolbachia* out of curious in the dataset, and found an entry in [`Prok_taxadata.txt`](https://github.com/InaMariaDeutschmann/GlobalNetworkMalaspinaHotmix/blob/main/00_Tables/Prok_taxdata.txt).\n\nNo comments on this since there's no entry in quality-controlled ASV dataset. But after I read the paper [@parvathi2020] that found *Wolbachia sp* being most abundant in deep-sea sediment microbial community, I would literally not be surprised anymore if people found *Wolbachia* being most dominant in the aerosol as next. They are so ABUNDANT and they are EVERYWHERE.\n\nBy the way, our *Wolbachia* - *Altica lythri* project is aiming for another publication in the proximate future. Stay tuned. See @rohlfing2024 for the latest publication.\n\n",
