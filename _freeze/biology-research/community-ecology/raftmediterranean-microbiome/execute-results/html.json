Kindly use TOC on the side to avoid getting lost.\n\n:::\n\n## Ocean Microbiome\n\nWe adopted the data processed and published by @deutschmann2024, and focused on the Mediterranean subset. Thank to the comprehensive record of ecological parameters of the samples, we were able to divide the Mediterranean subset of microbial network into subnetworks according to their depth. The data was originally categorized in 5 layers: \n\n- Surface (**SRF**): 0 - 3 m\n- Epipelagic (**EPI**): 12 - 50 m\n- Deep-Chlorophyll Maximum (**DCM**): 40 - 130 m\n- Mesopelagic (**MES**): 200 - 1000 m\n- Bathypelagic (**BAT**): 1100 - 3300 m\n\nWe have combined EPI and DCM for the sake of simplicity and also because DCM is recognized as part of EPI. EPI is also called as sunlit zone, where solar resource could still be utilized by photosynthesis. As the red light being absorbed faster than the blue light, in MES, also known as twilight zone, there's only dim blue light present, which can not be used for photosynthesis. Which will eventually as well disappear in BAT, at which depth the most area of Mediterranean Sea hits the sea floor.\n\nIn each layer, the species composition besides microorganism is different: in SRF and EPI, phytoplanktons are able to import solar energy into the ecosystem and this  attracts small zooplanktons to feed at this depth. As photosynthesis becomes no longer possible in MES, it is home to many nektons: fishes, squids, larger crustaceans, etc. In BAT, as we approach the sea floor, benthic fauna becomes an important part. Such differences in interaction partners will also affect microorganism communities. But in what extent? Or how are the communities different? Such question can be answered by analyzing the co-occurrence / association network. \n\n@deutschmann2024 has published an Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASV) abundance data, which comprises an abundance matrix in the form that each row represents a sample site and each column represents an OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit, commonly used in microbiology as proxies for species concept). This matrix directly represents an adjacency matrix for a species-location bipartite network.\n\nFor more information about ocean layers, kindly see [Know Your Ocean](https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/how-the-ocean-works/ocean-zones/) from WHOI.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## [R Setup]{.cl-sub}\n\n\n\n```r\nlibrary(bipartite)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(vegan)\nlibrary(geomtextpath)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\npath <- \"MediterraneanMicrobiome/\"\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLets get the data imported and start with some basic data wrangling:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nASV <- read.delim(paste0(path, \"data/ASV.txt\"), sep = \"\\t\", header = TRUE)\n# ASV = abundance data of OTUs at sampling locations (OTU x location)\nENV <- read.delim(paste0(path, \"data/ENV.txt\"), sep = \"\\t\", header = TRUE)\n# ENV = environmental data of sampling locatoins\nLOC <- read.delim(paste0(path, \"data/Sample_Classification.tsv\"), sep =\"\\t\", header = T)\n# LOC = Location data for sampling locations eg. depth / ocean layer\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n\n\n## [Data wrangling]{.cl-sub}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndfASV <- as.data.frame(t(ASV))\ntENV <- as.data.frame(t(ENV))\ncolnames(dfASV) <- ASV$ID \ndfASV <- dfASV[-1, ]\n\ndfASV <- dfASV %>% \n  mutate_at(1:5457, as.numeric) %>% # turning abundance data into numeric\n  mutate(Sample=row.names(dfASV))  # adding column with sampling location names \n  # rename(dfASV$name, Sample = name) # naming this column \"Sample\"\n\ncolnames(tENV) <- ENV$ID # renaming the columns after the ID column in the ENV dataset. \ntENV <- tENV[-1, ] # deleting the ID row in the tENV dataframe\ntENV <- tENV %>%\n  mutate(Sample=row.names(tENV)) # adding column with sampling location names\n  # rename(tENV$name, Sample = name) # naming this column \"Sample\"\n\nnew <- left_join(dfASV, LOC, by = NULL) # joining ASV and LOC dataframes\nnew <- left_join(new, tENV, by = NULL) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting for mediterranean sample locations:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew.MS <- new[new[, \"OceanRegion\"] == \"MS\", ] # subsetting for samples from Mediterranean sea (MS)\nsp.MS <- new.MS[, 1:5457] # subsetting only the species abundance part of the MS dataframe\nsp.MS <- sp.MS %>% \n  mutate_at(1:5457, as.numeric) # tuning df into numeric data.\nsp.MS <- sp.MS[, colSums(sp.MS) > 0] # only keeping columns where the sum is > 0. therefore getting rid off all OTUs not found in mediterranean sea\n\nsp.MS <- sp.MS %>%\n  mutate(Sample=new.MS$Sample) \n  # rename(sp.MS$name, Sample = name)\n\nENV.MS <- new.MS[, 5458:5473] # subsetting only location and environmental data of sampling locations in the MS\n\nMS <- left_join( # rejoining species abundance and location / environmental data of MS\n  sp.MS, \n  ENV.MS, \n  by = NULL\n)\n\nab.mtx.ncol <- 3208\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: \n\n`MS` is now a dataframe comprising `n = 145` rows as sample sites and `p = 3208` columns of OTU, which stores the abundance data in the form of an adjacency matrix.

In our case, considering the extreme skewness of the data and clear pattern, which transforming method to use does not really make big differences. But this is not always true. One should select these methods cautiously. *Hellinger* transformation is one way to reduce the weight of extremely high value. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab.mtx.tf <- decostand(ab.mtx, \"hellinger\")\nmax(ab.mtx.tf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.63905\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Perform NMDS\n\nEvery community ecologist should be familiar with the basic idea of NMDS, which is dimension reduction. It converts our *n* x *p* matrix into an *n* x *n* dissimilarity matrix. This steps allows flexible decision on how the distances should be calculated. A common choice while dealing with species composition is the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, as its semi-metric approach takes both presence/absence and abundance information into account. It is also default to `metaMDS()`.\n\nNMDS differs a bit from other ordination methods, like PCA, in handling the distances and calculating axes and coordinates. Its non-metric nature decided that the distance on the final plot does not represents the distances between dataset, but the ranking order. It also therefore, does not try to maximize the variability in axes, which means the axes are completely arbitrary and this technique is mainly used for visualization only [@bakker2024].\n\nBefore starting NMDS, we have to specify ***k***, which gives the number of axes we want to have. NMDS will then take iterative process to adjust the scaling. After each iteration, it calculates a ***stress*** values showing how nice the ordination represents real data. The value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means a perfect fit. It however indicates danger for interpreting the ordination already from 0.2. Generally a stress value under 0.1 is considered a good result [@clarke1993; @bakker2024]. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNMDS <- metaMDS(ab.mtx.tf, k=2, autotransform = F, trymax = 50)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n\n\n## [See the processing result]{.cl-sub}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRun 0 stress 0.07999079 \nRun 1 stress 0.08285436 \nRun 2 stress 0.07999154 \n...

A common way to show such categorical data in NMDS is to draw a convex hull on those clusters. \n\n### NMDS Hullplot using `{ggplot2}` \n\nThe basic idea is simply use `chull()` to identify the points from the same cluster that are on the border of the hull and draw a polygon using those points. But the problem is that we have some outliers here, especially from MES (those two neighboring BAT and SRF). Those points would surely become the one defining the convex hull, and makes the hull covering much more area than the cluster really does. \n\nTo address this, I additionally calculate the euclidean centroids of each cluster and filter out outliers by comparing their distances to the centroids with the median distances to the centroids from all points within the same cluster. Those points that has a distance larger than a threshold calculated from median distance with defined multiplier will not be included.\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n\n\n## [See the result if we do not exclude those points]{.cl-sub}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](raftmediterranean-microbiome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the coordinates of the hull border\noutliner <- function(coord, group_var,  threshold_factor = 2, threshold_func = median) {\n    centroid <- colMeans(coord[, c(1, 2)])\n    centroids <- matrix(c(rep(centroid[1], nrow(coord)), rep(centroid[2], nrow(coord))), ncol = 2)\n    \n    # Euclidean distances\n    coord$distances <- sqrt(rowSums((coord[, c(1, 2)] - centroids)^2))\n\n    # Set threshold\n    threshold <- threshold_factor * threshold_func(coord$distances)\n\n    # filter out points with distance larger than threshold\n    coord_in <- coord[coord$distances <= threshold, ]\n\n    outline_indices <- chull(coord_in[, c(1, 2)])\n\n    return(list(\n        borders = coord_in[outline_indices, ], \n        centroid = c(centroid, group = group_var[[1]])\n    ))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`threshold_factor` controls how conservative or inclusive the convex hull should be drawn.

Each layer forms a cluster that does not have much overlap with others, except EPI and SRF, which also make sense, because even microorganism in SRF might have different interacting partners than the rest of EPI, the environmental condition and the general species compositions, in particular functionally, should be very similar. This is also reflected by SRF on the far side of EPI with the largest distances to MES or BAT. \n\nThe space between MES and EPI, although they are not encapsulated by any of both, still reflects kind of \"bridge\" section, probably at which depth that both layers meet each other. There's a numerical depth data in `env`, which is principally continuous data complementing our layer categories. While we use hull plot to visualize categeories in NMDS, we can use contour line to visualize continuous variables. \n\n### Fitting smooth surface\n\nIf we imagine the variables we want to display as the third dimension of our points on NMDS, visualize the variables becomes generally visualize a 3-dimensional structure on our 2-D plot, one of whose answer is to fit the surface on our plot using `vegan::ordisurf()`.\n\nThe way to extract contour line from `vegan::ordisurf()` and the function `extract.xyz()` are credited to [Christopher Chizinski's post](https://chrischizinski.github.io/rstats/ordisurf/).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(geomtextpath)\nextract.xyz <- function(obj) {\n    print(obj)\n  xy <- expand.grid(x = obj$grid$x, y = obj$grid$y)\n  xyz <- cbind(xy, c(obj$grid$z))\n  names(xyz) <- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\")\n  return(xyz)\n}\n\ndepth.surf <- ordisurf(NMDS, env$depth, permutation = 999, na.rm = T, plot = F)\ndepth.contour <- extract.xyz(obj = depth.surf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nFamily: gaussian \nLink function: identity \n\nFormula:\ny ~ s(x1, x2, k = 10, bs = \"tp\", fx = FALSE)\n\nEstimated degrees of freedom:\n7.84  total = 8.84 \n\nREML score: 1057.237     \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np.NMDS.st.hull.cont <- p.NMDS.st.hull +\n    geom_textcontour(data = depth.contour, aes(x, y, z = z), color = \"#c4438c\") \n\np.NMDS.st.hull.cont\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](raftmediterranean-microbiome_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe depth just explained the cluster really well, and we see those points between MES and EPI are exactly around the transition depth.\n\nBut, what we did so far was basic descriptive work in community ecology.

Once we consider them as a network, we could subset them according to the water layer, and calculare indices respectively for comparison.

Kindly see [Vignette, section 5](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bipartite/vignettes/Intro2bipartite.pdf) for details. We have chosen some indices that we are interested in:\n\n- Connectance: \n- Linkage density: \n- Shannon diversity: \n- Interaction evenness: \n- Togetherness: \n- Network wide specialization index $H^{'}_2$:\n- Specialization asymmetry:\n\nI wrote a function that can apply the indices calculation to all matrices in a list and then summarize them in a data.frame. I also encapsulated them in parallel process (`{furrr}` package) to accelerate computation. Nonetheless, computing SA still consumed a large amount of time (1.5 hour on my machine), I have therefore dropped it from further analysis. \n\n```r\nlibrary(bipartite)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(furrr)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nnetwork.indices <- c(\"connectance\", \"linkage density\", \"Shannon diversity\", \"interaction evenness\",

I looked for them out of curious in the dataset, and found an entry in [`Prok_taxadata.txt`](https://github.com/InaMariaDeutschmann/GlobalNetworkMalaspinaHotmix/blob/main/00_Tables/Prok_taxdata.txt). In terms of network analysis, it will be extremely interesting to do a meta analysis on interaction between *Wolbachia* and their hosts, as well as those among their hosts and among themselves, considering the frequently occurring horizontal transfer (host switch) and gene recombination. Although this will probably be insanely complex since they are capable of so many things.\n\nNo comments on this one here since they are not included in quality-controlled ASV dataset, so it probably came from by-catch of their hosts (I wonder which) or contamination. But after I read the paper [@parvathi2020] which found *Wolbachia sp.* being most abundant in deep-sea sediment microbial community, I would literally not be surprised anymore if people found *Wolbachia* being most dominant in the aerosol of high-sky for next. They are EVERYWHERE.\n\nBy the way, our *Wolbachia* - *Altica lythri* project is aiming for another publication in the near future. Stay tuned. See @rohlfing2024 for the latest publication.\n\n\n## Reference\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution appearance=\"minimal\" style=\"font-sze:0.9rem; border-left: none; border: 1px solid var(--clcolor);\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## [R session and R packages]{.cl-title}\n\n\n\n\n### R session \n<hr>\nR version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS 15.2\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Berlin\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] furrr_0.3.1           future_1.34.0         geomtextpath_0.1.4   \n [4] ggpubr_0.6.0          bipartite_3.0.0.1     sna_2.8              \n [7] network_1.19.0        statnet.common_4.10.0 vegan_2.6-8          \n[10] lattice_0.22-6        permute_0.9-7         lubridate_1.9.3      \n[13] forcats_1.0.0         stringr_1.5.1         dplyr_1.1.4          \n[16] purrr_1.0.2           readr_2.1.5           tidyr_1.3.1          \n[19] tibble_3.2.1          ggplot2_3.5.1         tidyverse_2.0.0      \n[22] knitr_1.48            rmarkdown_2.28        pacman_0.5.1         \n\n\n### Packages \n<hr>\n\n\n#### bipartite\n\n\nVersion: 3.0.0.1 \n\nDormann C, Fruend J, Bluethgen N, Gruber B (2009). \"Indices, graphs and\nnull models: analyzing bipartite ecological networks.\" _The Open\nEcology Journal_, *2*, 7-24.\n\nDormann C, Gruber B, Fruend J (2008). \"Introducing the bipartite\nPackage: Analysing Ecological Networks.\" _R News_, *8*(2), 8-11.\n\nDormann C (2011). \"How to be a specialist?
