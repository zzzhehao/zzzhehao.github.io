The model is composed of a discriminant function (or, for more than two groups, a set of discriminant functions) based on linear combinations of the predictor variables that provide the best discrimination between the groups. The functions are generated from a sample of cases for which group membership is known; the functions can then be applied to new cases that have measurements for the predictor variables but have unknown group membership.\n\n# Script `Script_niche1.R`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#this is a way to open a datasheet using a txt file (which can be saved from excel)\nlizards<-(read.table(\"/Users/hu_zhehao/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Files/Obsidian/Cafe AgX HQ 2.0/004 Notes/M.Sc.
