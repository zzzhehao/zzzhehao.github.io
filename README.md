### Tips and Notes

I personally prefer [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) better than other genAI tool to assist my coding (it does a very good work considering it's free), although it can't solve every problem so always keep your brain sharp and learn from the AI and the process. Ask questions and make sure that you understand every step the AI suggested you do (do not just blindly copy the code!). I was completely new to HTML, CSS and JS when I started the website, after one month I could solve some basic issues on my own. Also there will always be some weird cases that AI can't solve, often with not very sufficient error message or even completely none. It might be due to IDE setting, Quarto-specific features, some unexpected conflict outside your focus, etc. In such cases, AI can't really help much.

I left some notes documenting thoughts and tips in [comments](https://zzzhehao.github.io/comments/website-construction.html) that may keep people stuck with problems or things hard to find on the internet. These notes may help someone who is constructing a website without prior knowledge of front-end development, like me.

By the way, I also strongly endorse Posit's new IDE [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron), it has been very comfortable to work with, in R and Python, in website building and data analysis. The only drawback for me is the refreshing / cache issue with Quarto dashboard using Shiny. But since Positron is still in beta, I think this will probably be fixed soon.
