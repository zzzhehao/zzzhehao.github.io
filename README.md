This is the source code for my website [zzzhehao.github.io](https://zzzhehao.github.io), feel free to share and use.

You are currently on the branch `main` where all MD (.qmd, .rmd) and CSS files are stored. The default branch `gh-pages` operates the website and is thus not tracked and rendered by Quarto.

I left some notes documenting thoughts and weird things in `comments` that I didn't find others mentioning on the internet. These notes may help someone who is constructing a website without prior knowledge of front-end development, like me. They are not index from anywhere on the website, but you can find them by searching "comment".

## Quarto

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to build this website.
