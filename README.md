## Quarto

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to build this website, it's powerful and easy to start with. I write Rmd in RStudio for notes and write other pages in Qmd or pure HTML in [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).

I left some notes documenting thoughts and tips in [comments](https://zzzhehao.github.io/comments/website-construction.html) that may keep people stuck with problems or things hard to find on the internet. These notes may help someone who is constructing a website without prior knowledge of front-end development, like me.
