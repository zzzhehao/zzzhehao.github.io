### Functions

There are some handy functions I wrote at `functions/` to assist my work.

- `custom-callout.R` True custom callout is currently not supported. I use less used callout-caution for my custom use. Detailes are described in roxygen2 style in script.
- `forward-message.R` Custom class element. Print out `description` of page's yaml header. See [here](/biology-research/asbiologist.qmd).
- `mapping-assist-shiny.R` A shiny app that helps cropping image using margin percentage. Helpful when using `data-crop` method in closeread (modified).
