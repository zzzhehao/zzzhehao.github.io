    "text": "👋 Hi, I am Zhehao.\nIf you are wondering how to speak my name, it’s ‘dʒe hao’, as 哲豪 written in Chinese. I was born in Japan but technically I am a Taiwanese citizen, I spent my first six years in Tokyo (東京) near Tamagawa (Tama-River) (多摩川) - which separate the capital and the neighboring district Kanagawa-Ken (神奈川県) is separated. I then went to school in Kunshan (昆山) , a small city neighbouring Shanghai (上海) until 2016, since then I went to high school in Schwerin (Germany, MV) and started my degree program in Hamburg since 2020. Recently I am more often staying in Kaohsiung (高雄) when I spend time with my folks.\n\n\nAt this point I have finished my B.Sc. in Biology and am currently pursuing my M.Sc degree. I have specialized myself in molecular biology, ecolutionary ecology, and bioinformatics through various experiences. But I am also interested in many other fields in general, such as microbiology, immunology, biotechnology that involves bioimaging, animal physiology, especially the adaptation of marine species, and I aim to combine my interests with my strength to contribute the research in a interdisciplinary way.\n\n\n\nTaking photos is one of my major hobby in personal life."

    "text": "What is NMDS?\nThe Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) is, as its name implicates, the MDS for non-metric data. Which can be more convenient in analyzing ecology data, since the ecological data often don’t follow the normal distribution.\nAs Wikipedia explains, the NMDS finds a non-parametric monotonic relationship between the dissimilarities in the item-item matrix and the Euclidean distance between items, and the location of each item in the low-dimensional space.\nTranslate this into simplified language, it says the NMDS …\n\nhighlights the similarities between samples of multidimensional measurements.\nreduces the dimensions of the multidimensional data, but the number of dimensions are predefined, in contrast to PCA and PCoA, which always show the most important two axes.\nanalyses distance matrix, which is commonly a dissimilarity distance matrix.\nis a visualization method, it has thus less precision and much less accountability for further usage of the analysis result in compare to the PCA. For a statistical assessment, additional tests regarding to particular hypothesis must be performed, and that’s why we are combining NMDS with PERMANOVA.\nuses a rank based approach (which makes NMDS a non-metric technic), this rank is maintained consistent while reducing dimensions (monotonic).\nis an iterative algorithm, which use stress values to guide the iteration (see ?metaMDS Details#4). NMDS tries to improve the iteration by randomly choosing starting point.\n\n\nStress\nThe inconsistency between the original high-dimensional data and the reduced low-dimensional data is measured by stress in each iteration. The value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means a perfecto fit and 1 means a big yikes.\nGenerally, stress values below 0.2 are considered acceptable, below 0.1 are good. The stress value should be reported with NMDS while publishing results.\nHigher number of samples often leads to higher stress value, also a very low stress value might indicate that the dataset is too small for the NMDS."

Fortunately, there’s a way to plot, not only the NMDS, also other ordination analyses from vegan using ggplot2. This can make our plot more precise and customizable.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWe continue with the already available NMDS result from earlier, which is stored inside tadNMDS. The only thing we need to do, is to extract the coordinates from the points we want to plot, and then apply them in a ggplot-way.\n\n# extract NMDS scores\nsiteCoord &lt;- as_tibble(scores(tadNMDS)$sites)\nspCoord &lt;- as_tibble(scores(tadNMDS)$species)\n\np.NMDS.sp &lt;- ggplot()+\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_aes() + # set themes, available in source code Rmd\n  MoMAColor() + # use MoMA color palattes, available in source code Rmd\n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +\n  geom_point(data = spCoord, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2), size = 2, shape = 3, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.9) +\n  ylim(-1.6, 2)\n\np.NMDS.sp.st &lt;- p.NMDS.sp +\n  geom_point(data = siteCoord, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2), color = \"#222222\", size = 3.5, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_text(data = siteCoord, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2, label = c(1:nrow(siteCoord))), color = \"white\", size = 1.8, alpha = 1, check_overlap = T)\n\np.NMDS.sp.st\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting environmental data with ggplot could be a bit complex.
