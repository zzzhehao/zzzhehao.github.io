    "text": "Niche Overlap\nIn my previous note, Ecological Niche, we talked about the basic ideas about the ecological niche and niche overlap. Understanding the niche overlap pattern, both intraspecific and interspecific, can help us obtain more insight into many topics, such as:\nEvolutionary:\n\nSexual Dimorphism by study difference in resource utilizing between males and females of the same species.\nSpeciation Process by study niche partitioning between sister taxa or subspecies.\n\nConservation:\n\nImpact of the Invasive Species by looking at the niche overlap between native and invasive species.\nEcological Guild by understanding niche overlap within a group sharing same or similar functional trait (e.g. pollinator communities).\n\nHowever, comparing niches among multiple species is challenging, as I mentioned already, since the ecological data are almost always multidimensional."

    "section": "Bayesian Workflow",
    "text": "Bayesian Workflow\n\nBayesian theorem\nvan de Schoot et al. (2021) described the very foundation idea of the Bayesian statistics as following:\nBayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution.\nThat means, we make an initial estimation of our parameters (prior distribution), we observe data and update the model (posterior distribution).\nThe Bayesian statistics is based on the Bayes’ theorem, which is mathematically stated as following:\n\\[\nP(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are events and \\(P(B)\\neq 0\\),\n\\(P(A|B)\\): the probability of event \\(A\\) occurring given that \\(B\\) is true. It is also called the posterior probability (briefly posterior) of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\).\n\\(P(B|A)\\) is also a conditional probability: the probability of event \\(B\\) occurring given that \\(A\\) is true. It can also be interpreted as the likelihood of \\(A\\) given a fixed \\(B\\) because \\(P(B|A)=L(A|B)\\). (\\(L\\): likelihood function)\n\\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) are the probabilities of observing \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the prior probability and marginal probability.\n\n\n\nWhy Bayesian Statistics?\nBayesian statistics is a whole other framework and approach on statistical analysis by putting the Bayes’ theorem at the center. Both classical and Bayesian inference, while trying to modelling data, have advantages and disadvantages of each. Bayesian inference is generally employed whenever uncertainty comes to play:\n\nThere is also a practical advantage of the Bayesian approach, which is that all its inferences are probabilistic and thus can be represented by random simulations. For this reason, whenever we want to summarize uncertainty in estimation beyond simple confidence intervals, and whenever we want to use regression models for predictions, we go Bayesian.\n― Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2024), P. 16\n\nSwanson et al. (2015) pointed out a viewpoint from the traditional niche overlap analysis that might introduce problems: geometric approach doesn’t account for uncertainty, and also lacks of direction. It is very well illustrated by Fig. 1 in the publication:\n\n\n\nComparison between geometric and probabilistic isotope overlap metrics. Isotope x is distributed in species A and B (x-axis); dashed lines show means. The 95% niche region (solid lines) of B is completely contained within that of A, such that the geometric overlap of B onto A is 100%. However, the probability that a randomly chosen member from A falls into the isotopic niche of B is only 35%. (Swanson et al. 2015)\n\n\nBy inviting the variance of the niche probability distribution, not only the mean, it now also differentiates the overlap in directions, which means the probability of a species A falling into species B is not equal to one of that species B falling into species A. And since this perspective starts to consider the probability in the models, a Bayesian workflow will provide more reliable and robust analysis.\n\n\nRandom Vector and Multivariate Normal Distribution\nGiven an individual statistical unit, in our case, the niche described by three isotope ratios, a random vector is a group of variables that describes this mathematical system. Which is again, in our case, those three values of the isotope ratio. The distribution of each component of the random vector together forms a multivariate distribution.\nWhen dealing with univariate (one-dimensional) analysis, we often assume that the variable is normally distributed. We do things likewise even with multivariate analysis. The multivariate normal distribution is a generalization of the univariate normal distribution into higher dimensions, but it’s not as simple as all components of the random vector being normal. It also requires every linear combination of arbitrary two components in the system being normally distributed (bivariate normal distribution), which is not always true even every single variable is normal on their own. And here comes the covariance matrix into play. Normal distribution is described by two variables, mean and standard deviation (sd), in which the latter being simply the square root of the variance.\n\n\nCovariance and covariance matrix\nCovariance is a measure of the joint variability of two variables, the sign of the covariance shows the tendency, i.e. one of the three possible linear relationships between two variables, which are:\n\nnegative linear relationship, covariance is &lt; 0\nno linear relationship, covariance is around 0\npositive linear relationship, covariance is &gt; 0\n\nThe variance is a special case of the covariance in which the two variables are identical. The covariance itself is sensitive to the scale of the data, and it does not provide information of in what extent the two variables correlate with each other and how well the linear correlation fits the data. All these characteristics make covariance difficult to interpret, but it has become an important step stone for many interesting subsequent analysis, such as PCA, correlation analysis, etc.\nA covariance matrix is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements, which is always symmetric, and the diagonal elements present the variance of each variable. The covariance matrix describe the joint behavior of every linear combination of two variables, analogue to univariate normal distribution, the covariance and the mean are used to described a multivariate normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about covariance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatQuest on YouTube (simply and clearly explained)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjugate Prior\nJackson et al. (2011) suggested that the normal distribution is generally appropriate when dealing with stable isotope ratio, and this gives us a way to simplify the analysis by taking advantage of the conjugate prior.\nA conjungate prior is a certain prior distribution, that when applied on certain likelihood function, the posterior distribution will also be in the same distribution family. Such as in univaraite analysis, a normal prior and a normal likelihood function results a normal posterior. In our case, the conjugate prior for the multivariate normal is the normal-inverse-wishart (NIW) distribution. It can be considered in two parts: the mean is following a normal distribution and the covariance is following an inverse-Wishart distribution. NIW is commonly used as the prior distribution when modeling a multivariate normal, but the mean and the covariances are unknown.\n\n\nThe probability of a random observation of a isotope ratio (\\(x\\)) belongs to species \\(s\\) is following a normal distribution.\n\\[\nP(x |\\text{species}=s) \\backsim N(\\mu_s \\, , \\Sigma_s)\n\\]"

This is the largest of the two-dimensional ellipse “slices” taken parallel to the UV-plane. The red ellipse is the 95% niche region constructed directly from isotopes U and V.

    "text": "Was it my choice, or my fate?\nI grew up in urban cities, but it did not keep me away from nature. Tamagawa (多摩川), a river that flows through Tokyo, shaped my first memories of nature. I have been interested in natural science since then. Yet, my four years in Schwerin had the most impact on my career choice. Schwerin was a small town surrounded by lakes, with nature within walking distance. I spent a lot of time wandering through the nature park and forests with my camera, which gradually drew me into this fantastic field. Birds, with their high mobility and integrated lifestyle with humans, became my favorite. Besides their freedom of flight, which I dreamed of at countless moments, I was also attracted to their elegance and intelligence.\n\n\n\nSeagull breeding its kid\n\n\nAnother passion of mine lies in the ocean. The magical power of the ocean has attracted me in so many ways, too many to sort through. It feels like a born instinct how the sounds of waves, the blue of the depths, and the twinkling of the water trigger my emotions and actions.\nI love thinking, sometimes even a bit too much. I have lost count of how many times I sat on the rocks, looking at the starlight’s reflection in the great lake of Schwerin, thinking about how vastly wide the universe is, and how insanely long time flows. Every time I think about this, I am amazed by the complexity of life, which blooms so brightly and desperately in the eye of Laplace’s demon.\n\nAll of this, and much more, have ultimately led me on the path of becoming a biologist."

    "text": "University\nI started my degree program in 2020 at Universität Hamburg and received my bachelor’s degree at 2024. Currently, I am further pursuing my master degree.\nBesides the basic modules obligatory for everyone studying biology, I attended various elective courses during my bachelor and master studies. Many of them have already paid off with knowledge and skills later on, and some have meaningfully shaped my current specialization.\n\nMolecular Biology\nLike many others, I thought about how my studies could support my future. The first time I stood at the crossroads, molecular biology, or specifically, biotechnology, seemed the most promising. But as I delved deeper, I noticed my lack of constant passion for the technology. They mean more as techniques and methods to me, not as research itself. I needed something more “biological” to immerse myself in. For the first time, I felt eager to answer questions at the front line of research. The questions which are confusing researchers, but also reveal the beauty of life. At the meantime, I had some new experience outside the lab, which reminded me on my original passion. This has made me decide that I don’t want to commit myself to a career that is totally inside the lab, but to take advantage of my knowledge and skills gained in this field to support my career that combines molecular biology with something else.\n\n\nThe first HiWi\nAll I have now, and who I have become, could never have been possible if I hadn’t sent that email back in 2022. It was the second time I saw the hiring ad for a student assistant. The professors in our department hire students yearly to assist with bachelor basic courses, particularly Animal Physiology in my case. Since these courses are mandatory, the number of attendees is high. In the first normal year after COVID, they faced a shortage of hands. Many others, who might have considered the job, were worried about whether they could be up to it, like I was. But seeing the ad twice?\n\n“Well, maybe my German is not good enough, maybe I didn’t have the best grade in that course, but why not give it a try?”\n\nI took it as a reminder of my fate and the last chance to get on that ride. And this, my friend, changed my life. Or anyway, my life would have to change at some point, but with this decision, I held the opportunity tight in my hand, even if I did not realize it back then.\nIt turned out the three-week job went very well. I had a good time and learned a lot, even though I was the one teaching others. This experience helped me overcome my anxiety in front of people, taught me the joy of helping others, and provided me with my first network in my career - with my future thesis supervisor, Dr. Kim Rohlfing.\n\n\nBachelor thesis\nKim was a very talkative and passionate person. During the week we led the course together, she told me a lot about the research group she was in, the elective courses they offered, and their research. I must admit, my first choice for the thesis was another group, but eventually, I asked Kim for an opportunity. At that point, I was still planning to build my career path toward molecular technology.\nThe research group was called “Molecular Evolutionary Biology” and run by Prof. Dr. Susanne Dobler, who taught the fundamental evolution course. I was assigned a fascinating topic about Wolbachia, a stunning bacteria in many insects with impressive witchcraft — manipulating the host’s reproduction behavior, and more. The deeper I dived into it, the more amazed I was. Researchers worldwide have dedicated decades to studying this bacteria, and even more are joining, but still, it is shrouded in mysteries, and this excited me. \nEventually, I have come to realize that evolution was exactly what caught me on this path in the first place. I learned about the basic concept of modern evolutionary theory when I was young, and since then, I have always tried to explain things with it. That’s also how I explained the universe to myself and why the universe amazes me every time. And the topic I dived into, not only Wolbachia but the research on things we don’t know about countless lives on this planet, i.e. the biodiversity, how it works, how it was shaped, and where it will go, the complexity of life, is exactly the radiant flower that dazzles Laplace’s demon.\nThe year in the research group was the most precious year I had during the program. I even had the opportunity to attend an academic conference, the DZG (German Zoological Society) annual meeting in Kassel as an undergraduate student. As I wrote in the acknowledgments of my thesis, I can’t express enough gratitude to Kim, my supervisor, who offered the opportunities in the first place; to Susanne, our group leader, for showing me how an honored researcher should be; to Mario Röpcke, a fellow PhD student in the group, and to Dr. Shabnam Mohammadi, for the various help they offered during the year. I will treasure this memory for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\nMe and my poster\n\n\n\n\nGoing Further\nWith my passion for evolution clarified, my goal became clear. Evolution does not stand alone; it is nothing more than ecology and genetics in relation to time. With that in mind, I began my master’s program and attended two courses - Evolutionary Systematics and Community Ecology. The former strengthened my understanding of evolution. As the course ended, I wrote this text in my notes:\n\nThis course has given me the tools to see the driving forces behind the universe. I’ve come to understand that evolution is not just about the historical development of species. Rather, it’s like an invisible hand from time itself, shaping our world.\n\nThe other one, Community Ecology, finally knitted a network between evolution and ecology for me by showing me how they interact with each other, and clarified how the conservation strategy works. Upon that, it also ‘officially’ connected data science with my career, by teaching us to deal with complex ecological data."

    "text": "Data Science - The Parallel\nThe importance of data science is nowadays no longer a news. I had a slight interest in it since a few years ago, and actually, my fourth preference when applying the university was data science (you can guess my third, it was not related to biology either). Although I am totally happy that I got accepted by B.Sc. biology program at UHH the day after my application, but the interest has remained. The bachelor biology program was reformed after two years after I started, where four semesters of data science course were brought into program to teach students R and be able to utilize digital methods to conduct basic statistical analysis. My program did not have that, we even brought F-table into exam to do some hand-made ANOVA.\nBut I got lucky, I chose to start taking elective course earlier than suggested and replaced the basic biostatistics module with Data Analysis in Ecology (with R) (what I mean by ‘replace’ was actually skipping the basic module because the attendance was not checked). That was where I learned R and was introduced to the world of reproducible research.\nEven if I hadn’t taken course back then, I guess I would have still learned R at some point. As our lecturer suggested, I have used R regularly since then, including in my thesis and the Community Ecology course. I love the feeling of searching for new results in the sea of data, it’s like a magical power that can find peace in a chaotic world. This evoked more interest inside me, such as building this website. Despite all the convenient features provided by Quarto, it still requires a certain level of project management skill to keep everythings clean, tidy, and understandable.\nEarlier this year, I had some time without university courses, I used it to attend courses on Coursera, where many universities offer various courses. I introduced myself to bioinformatics, from simple motif finding to genome assembly, further to sequence comparison and ultimately to big data, in hope that I will use this knowledge in my future career (I’m sure I will)."

But I must admit, as I am still pursuing my master degree, I’m still not completely sure of the exact specific topic I will push toward, It will more probably be a spontaneous decision based on availability of different opportunities, but I certainly have some personal interest, such as the marine mammals, crustacean, sea birds, reptiles, Wolbachia of course (but less in insects themselves tho), some Crsutaceans (e.g. Rhizocephala is a very stunning group in view of evolution, also in physiology, developmental biology, and morphology, they are just too unique).\nBeside all I mentioned, I also learn new things from other branches out of general interest, such as other courses I attended: molecular parasitology, molecular immunology, biodiversity of marine deep-sea habitats, biodiversity of fungi, etc. I am encouraged by a concept to do this:\n\n“T-shaped people”, those with a depth of knowledge in at least one discipline and a breadth of knowledge about innovation and entrepreneurship that allows them to work effectively with professionals on other disciplines to bring their ideas to life.”\n― Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20\n\nInterdisciplinarity has become an important aspect of research nowadays, especially in such complex subject like biology, I am extremely certain that I will work with people from other disciplines, and my goal is to contribute to research, particularly in species evolution, in view of its interaction with the environment and the humans, especially in terms of conservation, in an interdisciplinary way."

    "text": "This file is not meant to be included in the website, if it renders weirdly, try open it on GitHub.\nThis comment notes some things not widely mentioned on the internet and can be confusing for beginners while trying to construct the website.\n\n2024/07/14\n\nQuarto is sensitive to tabs, especially when dealing with html. If seeing html code printed out in the preview, try delete tabs in the line. Sometimes three tabs can already cause difference.\nQuarto may need some other effort to let JS be called in .qmd using html &lt;script&gt; and operate.\n\nsee here and maybe also here.\n\nAn example may involving batch construct here\nA brilliant show case of automatically extracting photo exif and showing them while inspecting photo, can maybe used otherwise, example and source code\nAlso see lightbox tool\nDesign: hamada hideaki\n\n\n\n2024/07/19 Apply Javascript\n\nQuarto treats Javascript differently (although I don’t know Javascript at all but certainly it is a bit more complex than in pure html), use following front matter yaml header to include the script:\ninclude-after-body: \n- text: |\n    &lt;script src=\"gallery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nI asked Perplexity a lot while constructing my site, I really have no idea in front end development, but I do recommend Perplexity for coding and information searching – it is really powerful.\n\n\n\n2024/07/22 !important: Assets management\n\nFor everyone have assets in their webstie, spend some time reading Quarto documentation.\nI was confused as hell today as every time I run $ quarto render it just delete every image I stored under _site/, then I realized that the way I managed the assets must not have been legitimate. So even though this took me whole night to figure out but it certainly prevented a huge mess up in the foreseeable future.\nBriefly, put all assets file outside the output file and manage as you want, but specify them in _quarto.yml using ‘resource’ option, incase you somehow not direclty linked them (e.g. my gallery’s full-screen view calls images via JavaScript). Everything under ‘resource’ option will be forcibly exported by quarto in its output and could be used normally by html files. I think this should be the most reasonable way that won’t mess up in the future.\nHonestly, I rolled back like 5 times this evening to find this out.\n\n\n\n2024/07/23 HTML custom footer\n\nAI can’t 100% take over to build your site for you. I struggled since a few days with the footer, the main problem was:\n\nQuarto has its own footer options in _quarto.yml: page-footer, body-footer or margin-footer, but they are all website-wide, and it can’t be turned off locally (page-footer: false yaml header somehow does not work, I don’t know if it is a bug or intended). As you see, it is not optimal for me since I have several highly customized pages (index, gallery)\nThe alternative is to build the footer directly with html. But if you want to keep the project tidy and clean, the best way is to create the footer separately in one file and assign it via _metadata.yml, otherwise it will be a catastrophe if I want to change the footer across website in a later point. And this, my friend, is a horrible quest for someone who has no idea about html, because you can encounter numerous strange problems like footer completely destroy quarto’s default layout or forcibly expanding page height and show unnessary scroller, etc. But I found this and modified upon it. I totally love it. Now I can put anything I want in the footer and even make variations of it.\n\nSCSS Variable List\n\n\n\n2024/07/27 Custom Background\n\nCustomizing background with image is quite easy in pure HTML/CSS, but in quarto it might be messy if TOC is enabled. Direclty use body {background-image} will let TOC stuck at highlighting the last element regardless where you are.\nTo bypass this it needs to define another class, and use it inside the .qmd body. To avoid a two-step workflow, I no longer use css to achieve custom background but use HTML file specifying css. So the step is create a html file:\n&lt;style&gt;\n    .background-container {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    background-image: url('image.jpg');\n    background-size: cover;\n    background-position: center;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-attachment: fixed;\n    z-index: -2;\n    }\n\n    /* If you want to mute the background a bit */\n    .background-overlay {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    background-color: rgba(39, 45, 50, 0.6);\n    z-index: -1;\n    }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- You need to call the section to finally insert image.\nWhen calling upper part using CSS, you will need to manually insert the part below in MD body. --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"background-container\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"background-overlay\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nCall this html file in yaml header via:\nformat:\nhtml:\n    include-in-header: bg.html\nThe idea is to bypass the utilization of body section which is used by quarto. (Omg I’m actually starting to understand HTML and CSS)\nSee next point. Since the image url is relative, it will not work if the .qmd file is at different level. If the background is not widely used across the website, the path can be corrected by inserting following right after yml header (oh dear I really understand HTML and CSS now)\n&lt;div class=\"background-container\"; style=\"background-image: url('corrected/image.jpg');\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nI ran into the same problem when I try to apply footer.html to files at different level, then I realize this must not be legitimate. I did some searching and it turns out it’s a common knowledge in front-end developing that / directly uses the project root. So just put following in _quarto.yml and then use absolute path in html (but not in yaml, there you still need to define the relative path)\nproject:\n  execute-dir: project\n\n\n\n2024/07/28 404 page and project path\n\nFollowing up last point, I ran into an even weirder situation while designing 404 page (type whatever under my site to see it). I wanted to use custom background but the problem is 404 page could be rendered everywhere at any depth as the user ran into invalid address. Which means the image I use is at different relative location to the rendered 404 page.\nI found this discussion and one of the developer stated that we can use project path (same as the one mentioned in the last point) in yaml header, but it seems not be a simple / but rather a ./, but I am not hundred percent sure.\nI also found this issue and it further confused me plus it’s been labeled as a future feature that has been delayed twice, so I gave up with this.\nWeird thing is, I somehow couldn’t use project path within the html, so I ended up with a JS script that can generate a relative path. For now I embeded it in the theme/bg-red-plane-2.html since I don’t need it anywhere else so I don’t want to touch it. If you also have similar problem, maybe check it out.\n\n\n\n2024/08/20 Shiny Dashboard with multiple pages\nIt’s not really from this website construction - but I was lately working with implementing a Quarto dashboard with interactivity by shiny. Positron has currently the problem that when you open other page than the original rendered one in its viewer, also in your browser, it will not automatically load it. You need hit refresh to load that page.\nWith page here I mean every formatting you achived by putting things under a secon heading 1."

Several things I encountered on my first day trying this:\n\nYou can’t use image caption, otherwise the image will be rendered as a quarto object, the closeread formatting will no longer apply to them.\nThere’s a very weired compatibility issue with Quarto file structure, I am not 100% sure for the cause, but I noticed if I put a qmd file using closeread custom html as output format under a folder, which was already existing before the extension was installed, it will produce an error while previewing or rendering, saying that the renaming event is failed because the path is not found (the origin or the destination? IDK). If manually, we can try a second attempt without any modification and it will work, but when rendering the whole site, this error kills the process. But all things will work out if you put the file under a new folder, or directly under the root folder.\nI am not reporting this, because I still can’t really reproduce the issue with another minimal Quarto project, which means there might be another issue source in my website that I haven’t identified. 🤷‍♂️"

    "text": "Biological Meaning\nData on niches can be used to:\n\nMake comparisons of the composition and organization of communities.\nExamine shifts in the behavior or ecology of one species in response to another species.\n\nNiche shifts are commonly used to study interspecific competition (see Gause’s Principle of Competitive Exclusion)\n\n\n\n2.1 Hutchingson’s model of niche as a “hypervolume”\nNiches can be described or defined by relating fitness or utilization to environmental variable (abiotic and biotic).\n\nA range, given the conditions are defined by many axes, which defines the set of conditions under which the animal can survive and reproduce.\nWe can easily illustrate a niche described by up to 3 variables (3-D space), but for fourth axes and onward, the result becomes a hypervolume.\n\nBe aware:\n\nnot all niche axes are environmental - some niche axes are behaviroal (e.g. noctural vs. diurnal)\nnot all axes can be ordered linearly (e.g. types of antipredator behavior)\n\n\n\n2.2 Fundamental niche vs Realized niche\n\nFundamental niche (FN) is the entire set of conditions under which an animal (a population, a species) can survive and reproduce.\nRealized niche (RN) is the set of condition actually used by given animal (a population, a species) after interactions with other species have been taken into account.\nFN ≥ RN\nRN may differ in populations, because of differences in competitors and predators.\n\n\n\n2.3 Niche breadth\n\nSpecialists have narrow niches, generalists have broad niches. These are however relative terms.\nDescribes the endpoints of continuous variation in the degree of specialization in resource use, behavior, and physiology.\n\n\n2.3.1 LEVINS (1966) - Niche breadth quantification\n\\[B = \\frac{1}{\\sum{p_i^2}}\\]\n\n\\(p_i\\) = proportion of individuals that use resource \\(i\\)\nSpecies that use many resources will have large value of \\(B\\), reflecting a generalist pattern of resource use.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Between or within phenotypes\n\nGiven known niche breadth of a population, it is however not necessarily clear how individuals within population use resources. There are possibly two patterns:\n\nAll individuals use entire niche of population, within-phenotype component of niche breadth is large\nEach individuals uses a narrow part of population’s niche, between-phenotype component of niche breadth is large.\n\nIndividual’s niches may change dramatically during lifetime (e.g. metamorphosis, tadpoles are herbivores, frogs are carnivores)\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Niche overlap\n\n2.4.1 Types of overlap\n\nCoextensive, included, reciprocal overlap, asymmetric overlap\nNon-overlapping: abutting, disjunct\n\n\n\n\n(Creel 2021)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Jacobs (1974) - Electivity index\nElectivity indices measure the utilization of food types in relation to their abundance or availability in the environment (Lechowicz 1982).\n\\[ D = \\frac{r-p}{r+p-2rp}\n\\]\n\n\\(R\\): proportion of item used; \\(P\\): proportion of item available.\nModified from forage ratio and Ivlev’s index (1961), Fig. 12 in Jacobs (1974).\nJacob’s index is independent of the relative abundance of food types in the environment.\nAlso purposing \\(log Q\\) index, both should be tested when a relation is studied between food selection and variables such as the relative abundance of food, light conditions, etc.\nRanges from -1 to 1, where 0 as separator of positive or negative selection.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Pianka (1973) - Pianka’s niche overlap index\nModification of one presented in MacArthur & Levins (1967).\n\\[ O_{kj} = \\frac{\\sum p_{ij}p_{ik}}{\\sqrt{\\sum p^2_{ij}\\sum p^2_{ik}}}\n\\]\nThis formula is symmetric, i.e. \\(O_{jk} = O_{kj}\\) - \\(P\\): proportion of item \\(i\\) used in relation to the total of items used by species \\(j/k\\).\n\n\n2.4.4 Winemiller and Pianka (1990) - Randomization algorithm\nWhile testing for the statistical significance related to niche overlap, the major challenge is that the null model is unknown, the niche overlaps are dependent on each party of the interactions. Thus as Winemiller and Pianka (1990) explained, the standard statistical tests cannot be applied to comparisons involving three or more species. To bypass this, an idea is to generate the null model from the limited data we can collect:\n\n… generate different replicates of a randomized real system (i.e. pseudo-community, the null model) that can be constructed for comparison with an observed prototype.\nIf say, 95 or 99 of 100 randomized pseudo-communities have mean niche overlaps greater than the observed, results are significant at the P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01 level, respectively.\n\nSuch significance indicates that:\n\nObserved community exhibits a non-random pattern of resource utilization.\nSpecies in observed community are utilizing resources in a way that minimized competition.\nEvidence of niche differentiation or resource partitioning among the species in community.\nEvidence for competitive interactions shaping community structure or for past evolutionary adaptations.\n\n4 different algorithm:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelaxed niche breadth(Sum value is redistributed)\nRetained niche breadth(Values are shuffled, but not redistributed)\n\n\n\n\nZeros eliminated(categories with 0 are also reassigned with value)\nRA1\nRA3\n\n\nZeros retained(categories with 0 are reassigned)\nRA2\nRA4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Use of niches to examine distribution and abundance of species\nSee Creel (2021) for examples.\nList of terms:\n\nInterspecific and intraspecific competition\nNiche expansion, niche contraction\nCompetitive exclusion\nCharacter displacement\nGhost of Competition Past\nTranslocation experiments"

    "text": "What I do in free time\n\nPhotography\nPhotography is one of my major hobbies in personal life. It has also brought me to the current career path, I did once consider making it as my profession, but after all, I was not bold enough to overcome the fear of constantly seeking for jobs and dealing with a turbulent work life. (Is studying evolution any better 🤨!?)\nSo currently, I casaully take photos in digital and analog films, also some jobs like concerts recording, wedding photography, etc, given opportunity. I actually want to make creative and not business-driven projects, but I haven’t yet made something so far 😕. Earlier I used to run a tiny business for developing and scanning films, but only to avoid the chemicals expiring because there are not so many films to process from me. As I got more and more to do for my career, I cut it out too and now I only casually develop films for friends (still charged, of course, but you can get my way of processing if you like, see my film photos here).\nOf course, occasionally I also do some other things more than just taking photo. Such as shooting some super-8 film for special events in my life, experimenting with the cyanotype technique on sunny days. I also once modified an instax camera and fused it with my Mamiya RB67. If I go diving, I will grab a GoPro and drift in the water too.\nSometimes, you can also see me have a camera around my neck or hung on my shouder but not seeing me taking any photo.\nYou know, I’m just staying casual.\nPhotography has taught me how to live my life in a positive way, it gave me the ability to notice the small things which made the world a wonderful place. Sometimes I also want to feel the moment by myself and not be distracted by thinking how to take a good photo, and I also don’t want to turn this all into stressful work. So I rarely care about any composition rules, etc., I just record everything I think it’s beautiful.\n\n\n\nMe casually taking a photo\n\n\nIt’s impossible to convey all my thoughts and mindset about photography in such short text, even impossible in one post. It has become a way for me to express myself and connect with the world. My photos should be the one telling you my stories and my philosophy.\n\n\nCoding\nThis one is quite obvious, I mean, who would have ever casually thought “well today’s a nice day, let’s make a website” and then spent countless hours reading through those dry and dull documents tasting like well-done steak just to make a full-customized and “once being set up then easy to maintain” website?\nBut seriously, I already had the idea of making a personal website for a while, I tried for several options, such as Squarespace, Notion, etc. They are all good at some points, but also really restricted. Squarespace has fancy templates but costs money and is not easy to construct. Notion is, honestly after I started writing in pure Markdown with Obsidian, I just can’t work with Notion’s file management logic and UI design anymore, although making personal website is not its main feature anyway. Also the entire cloud-based storage is a huge bomb that can go off unexpectedly anytime.\nThe main reason for me to make a site is to share my notes. Everytime I tried so hard writing good notes, but in the end I’m the only one reading it makes me feel kind of sad. Especially during one course I had not long ago, I worked with R and combined methods posted by different people on their own websites and made a really good plot, which I cracked the code by myself and never saw anywhere before. I wanted to share it, I first tried Rpubs but that thing was like centuries old and certainly not actively well maintained anymore, then I learned about Quarto and ended up here. Despite some weird things and restrictions that require extra bypass (I logged them here), Quarto is really easy to learn and start with to build a website for those who has no experience in front-end developing.\nSaying that, I have general interest in programming too, not the SQL-database management or the front/back-end developing kind of programming, but the “I don’t need financial analysis app because I have my own R shiny app for it” kind of thing. I really enjoy the feeling of solving problems with programming, but I’m definetely not commited for business-scale huge projects which are probably gonna consume my life.\nI like keeping it casual, you know? 😏 (okay this starts to sound a bit wrong)\n\n\nCoffee\nWho knows me personally knows also that I drink a lot coffee and love the vibe. I have no interest in becoming a coffee taster or a barista but I love to try different coffee brands and drink with others, preferably while listening to some jazz from Cannonbal Adderley and talking about Jean-Paul Satre and Edvard Munch, or about the cute kitty you saw on the street and the new leaf my Monstera has grown lately.\nBy the way, I also drink coffee virtually.\n\nlibrary(kitchen)\n\nCappuccino &lt;- function(coffee, type) {\n  if (type == \"whole\") {\n    coffee &lt;- grind(coffee, size = extra_fine)\n  }\n  \n  espresso &lt;- Moka.pot(coffee, size = 2, heat_level = medium, min = 5)\n  foam &lt;- froth(milk)\n  milk &lt;- steam(milk)\n  cappuccino &lt;- latte.art(espresso, foam, milk)\n  \n  return(cappuccino)\n}\n\nCoffee &lt;- Cappuccino(Okinawa_Sango_Roast, \"whole\")\nSip(Coffee)\n\n\n\nHiking\nTo prevent making myself in a glass-wearing-nerd stereotype, I also want to say I love hiking too. Earlier I was more into the ocean, but at some point, I started to miss the mountains too. But as you know, the Northern Germany has only plain, so if not on vacation, I am just occasionally hiking around Hamburg and the small town nereby. I usually plan for a hike about 3-4 days earlier, depending on the weather forecast, preferably starting early on weekdays (like 8 or 9 a.m.), if you are interested, just reach out!\nIf I get away from cities far enough, I also take all chances to do some astrophotography, although not very professional because the gears are SUPER expensive and I also want to keep it simple, i.e. even if I have the equipments, I woule be too lazy to carry around 20 kg gear and spend hours setting up, not to mention maintaining them regularly. I will save that hobby for later 😉.\n\n\n\nNorthern sky at a night in Schwarzwald, my favourite constellation is Orion and my favourite star (beside the Sun) is Antares, they have a nice background story\n\n\n\n\nDiving\nAfter I learned to dive in 2022, I have already been to some places for diving. I totally love the feeling of not feeling gravity and just chill in my trim. With my study background, you know I dive for the stunning creatures in the water, so I’m not very sporty in this, I don’t (want to) dive in caves, I don’t go deeper than the normal gas allows me (I’ve been to 42 m and it really made my brain heavy), and so far I don’t see any reason for me to go further for tech dive in the near future.\nI just love messing around with Nemo and searching for some beautiful sea slugs. Also I absolutely love night dive, most creatures are more active at night and while people plan the night dive always at smaller depth, it lasts longer with the gas. I once encountered 9 octopus and three eels (one of them was even during the hunting) within an hour’s dive, it felt like heaven and was really the best dive I had so far.\nOr maybe not? I also love another dive where a sea turtle swam past me unbothered (they are in that attitude most of the time, I hope I can have the same mindset).\n\n\n\nProbably Chromodoris elisabethina in Kenting (GoPro’s shitty focus)\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Sea Turtle, also in Kenting\n\n\n\n\nVinyl & Music\nI already mentioned my love to some old suff, i.e. the analog photography. I have integrated my daily life into it. Another old stuff I love is the vinyl. What so attracts me is more the music on it than the vinyl itself, but I also like how the process of taking the disk out of the shelves, putting it on the player, carefully placing the needle and waiting for the music start. Instead of click a few bottoms on a flat screen. It feel more real and this feeling simply connects people with the music more strongly.\n\n\nI listen to a lot of old songs, one reason is that I’m so into Jazz and the last century was the golden time of the golden time of the jazz (no it’s not a typo). There’s certainly some bias within, that the most music which survived till today should be one of the best, the others which were not so famous, had eventually vanished in the history. I go crazy for the classics, but I also embrace this part of music which is going to be forgotten.\n\nBut in case of the Jazz, maybe I just simply prefer jazz from early time better, like from Eddie Higgins, Cannonball Adderley, Acker Bilk, John Coltrane, Frank Sinatra, and so many more. From New Orleans, Swing, Big Bands, Bebop, to Cool Jazz, Hard bop, Latin Jazz (Bossa Nova!). Fusion is also one of my favorite, I really love the early sci-fi kind of music made by Spyro gyra, The Rippingtons, and Yellowjacket. Honestly, even if it comes to the ultra-classic pieces like Autumn Leaves, many old versions just totally roll out the new ones.\nBesides that, I’m also very into pop and country music from the late 20th century, I probably got influenced by my parents on this point, like Yesterday once more from Carpenters was one of my favorite song when I was a kid, and now I have countless playlists from that time. Both Sides, Now from Joni Mitchell, Say You, Say Me from Lionel Richie, Sometimes When We Touch by Dan Hill, Poems, Prayers and Promises from John Denver, Don’t Know Much by Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville, Nothing’s Gonna Change My Love for You from George Benson, Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton? You must have heard at least one, probably all of them, they are just so perfect 📀.\nAdding to that, my early life has also exposed me to many Japanese songs, compare to modern J-Pop, I’m more into City pop, which is very famouse abroad, but also post-war enka (sentimental ballads which adopts a lot of traditional elements), pop, rock and folk during and after the bubble-era (~’85 to 00). Tamaki Koji (玉置浩二) is my favourite artist of all time, his songs have a characteristic bitter-sweet nostalgic feeling, that always comforts my nerve. Just listen to a wonderful live albumn from him, and you will probably fall in love with his music too.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nPlants\nDespite I had terrible grade in Botanic (the exam was really hard and I really can’t remember all the Poaceae morphology), I am a plant lover. If you are walking with me on the street and suddenly realize that I’ve been quiet for a while, I’m probably stuck in some random bush 100 meters behind you. I also have some plants at home (not always plants; I once harvested some unexpected mushrooms 🍄‍🟫). There’s a Monstera that I adopted from IKEA three years ago, and now it’s causing me headache since it grew too fast and I have to regularly give away some cuttings.\n\n\n\nMonstera being wild\n\n\n\n\n\nI really have no idea how it came into my house\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals\nI don’t know if I even need to mention this, but specifically I love cats. I don’t live with any because I still don’t see a stable future even for myself, so I’m not dragging another innocent life into it, but I always take any chance I have to pet cats. Fortunately I just know one cat who shows his unconditional love to me so actively every time I meet him."
