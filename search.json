    "text": "The first thing that deeply touched me in Punta Areas was actually the sky after walking out of the airport. It was a beautiful afternoon, the sun shining from a low angle, making the light orange and warm, long shadows follow us. Lifting my head up, there’s nothing but sky.\nIt sounds very normal, but it’s actually a precious moment for a human living in a city, where there’s always a building in your field of vision.\nIt felt like the sky was like a cozy, warm tower, covering my eyes.\nAnd I think the wild nature just gave me a gentle hug."

    "text": "Heart That Travels\n\n\n私たちはここまで速く歩き過ぎてしまい、心を置き去りにしてきてしまった。心がこの場所に追いつくまで、私たちはしばらくここで待っているのです。\n\n\n（星野道夫, 旅をする木, p. 41-42）\n\nI still can’t quite believe that it’s happening. The weekend also feels like it has gone by so quickly, that literally the night before I left, I was still at the institute late at night, busy describing species. The next day I was already packed and on the plane, to the far south of this planet, a place I dreamed to visit. The whole thing has happened so quickly that it feels unreal. I’d be lying if I said Antarctica wasn’t not on my list, but it’s more on the “fantasy” list than the “okay-this-is-our-next-stop” list. The sense of unreality, the disconnect between where I really am and what I really feel, is crazy.\nThe total travel time was 20 hours flight plus 10 hours groud time. I took some Japanese books with me, partly because these Japanaese books are small and compact and are always my go-to book for traveling, but also because I haven’t read them for a while, and I missed a bit the world in those words.「旅をする木」by Michio Hoshino, is one of my favourite book. I read it for the first time five years ago, and it really became the book that has affected me all my mentality since. I didn’t remember too much about the content, but I do remember the shocking feeling he gave me with his stories in Alaska, and the spruce tree seed he planted in my mind.\nSince it has now grown into a big tree.\nThe interesting thing is that the following story was also written by him when he was visiting South America. Although he was vising the Galapagos Islands as part of a photography project and invited by the Ecuadorian government. The story goes that a group of palaeontologist went into the Andes, after days of rushing, the local guides suddenly went on strike and refused to move. The expedition leader tried to increase their pay, but the guides wouldn’t budge.\nIt wasn’t about the money at all, it was that they were going too fast, so fast that their heart (“心”) couldn’t keep up. They’re waiting for their heart to catch up, and until they find their heart again, they won’t move.\nI feel something similar here, apparently the means of transport does make a difference, I guess I would have much more emotion and feeling if I started sailing from Hamburg all the way down to the Southern Ocean, but it’s not really about that, but it’s more about how the mentality is set in me. Either it doesn’t mean to literally take the “heart” with us on our travels, but the truth is that the heart comes with us on its own when we start to connect with our destination, whether it’s the people, the culture, the landscape, or the history. When we start to live in the moment, when we start to connect with what is there at the local, then we have really been there for the first time.\nMaking a real connection is not just as easy as a matter of knowledge, but rather a matter of understanding. Understanding the lives of the people in that place, understanding their culture and their history, what was the past and what will be the future, how they have made decisions, and how they are building their time ahead.\nAnd I think that is exactly what I am missing now. What makes me feel overwhelmed, excited, but at the same time like I am floating in the air, looking for a place to settle down on the land in thick fog.\n\n\n\nSouthern Lapwing walking along the coast"

But I didn’t close the curtains and the early morning light woke me up before my alarm. The cold yesterday evening brought back the feeling of being back in Hamburg, I almost forgot it was summer in Punta Arenas.\nHeaded downstairs, had a wonderful breakfast with lovely conversation about …\n\nbeing submerged or lost in the space, which one would we choose to end our lives;\nkidnapping penguins;\nhot chocolate is good for the soul;\n\n… kind of stuff.\nAfter getting some done in my room, I went for a walk but met with one of our team and an Japanese man at the lobby. The old man is a retired marine biologist who now lives in Tokyo. He was happened to be in the town today with another cruise ship, where he had been invited by the cruise company to give a presentation to the public about the deep sea biology going on beneath their ship. We sat in the lobby for a while and we started talking in Japanese, it took me a while to reboot all my Japanese program, but it was an unusual feeling to speak Japanese in such a southern land.\nWe went for lunch to a place called Lumitos, suggested by one of our members who has been here many times, and it seems that avocado is the speciality of the place. I don’t have much of an opinion on avocado in general, but I do don’t like people in a place where almost no avocado is produced, but still try to put avocado in almost everything ( I don’t know pineapple on pizza, but avocado in sushi is an absolute sin). Palta (Chilean way to call avocado) seems to be a speciality here in Chile, I also tried the similar dish at Santiago airport - Italian style burger with avocado. I used to have a lot of stereotypes about airport restaurants, as I always thought they were expensive and bad at making food. But apparently that was not true of the dish in Santiago, and Lumitos is just a different kind of amazing.\nThe professor told me that he might be involved as an advisor while R/V Sonne is going to have few expeditions around Japan next year, which reminded me that the Sonne is indeed on the western side of the Pacific right now and I do know that there will be a transit cruise from Yokohama to Hawaii next summer.\nWe walked him to the center of the town, where he would meet the rest of the tourists and be picked up by the shuttle bus. The ship docked just behind the Falkor (too), and it just made the Falkor (too) look so tiny.\n\n\n\nLocal doggo led us to the port, stared afar"

    "text": "History, Nature, and their Trails\nI took a walk along the coast where I noticed that there are a lot of broken structures on the coast, mostly wooden or simple steel structures. Such as a wooden quay which fully brocken off from the coast and has now turned into a place for cormorants to gather. I didn’t think too much about it at first and just assumed that they were build for tourism, which doesn’t make any sense if they are broken and abandoned. Later I googled Punta Arenas again and found the sentence I was missing, which could explain this just perfectly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Punta Arenas harbour, although exposed to storms, was considered one of the most important in Chile before the construction of the Panama Canal. It was used as a coaling station by the steamships transiting between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Today it is mostly used by tourism cruises and scientific expeditions.\n(Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAnd if we look at the time when the Panama Canal was completed (1910s), the style of these abandoned quays matches with the explanation.\nThe constellation on the flag of Magallanes, the Chilean province of this area, was very clear to me that these five stars meant the Southern Crux - but then I suddenly realized that I had seen them in so many other places - on the flags of New Zealand and Australia, and apparently also on the the flag of Brazil. I have known those flags for so long and never bothered to look up what those stars mean.\nWhen I was walking in the city during the day, I saw a structure on top of a house but could not guess what that it was used for. It looks like a ventilation pipe but has a hammer shark like shape. My first thought was some sort of antenna or lightning conductor, but the width of the pipe doesn’t make sense at all. Later the day, I saw the same structure on another house and realized that it was indeed a ventilation pipe coming out of the house, which makes it then a chimney in Magallanic style, and I actually guess that the hammer shark like shape is to prevent the snow from falling into the pipe, which is also why the two short pipes over the branch don’t have a bottom.\n\n\n\nAbandoned quays"

    "text": "Speed of the Time\nHow people perceive time is quite an interesting thing, what feels like a fraction of a second can be an eternity to other people. What’s even more interesting is how people, despite the fact that the physical time doesn’t care about human’s will at all, still constantly wishing the time fly faster or flow slowly. In essence, “time” is mostly just a convenient term that human made up.\nEven funnier, is how people associate value with time. Sometimes less time is better, sometimes more time is better. Time matters for everything but is however the very last thing that really determines the value.\nGrowing up in a place where people are proud of thousands of years “uninterrupted” history, it’s not hard to hear some people theorize that the length of such “continuous” history defines the superiority of a civilization. Who could ever possibly be in a position to draw such a conclusion without admitting that it is just a pure cultural bullying?\nAnd I realized that such thoughts are not at all rare - people invented time and then made up a theory that uses time to dominate each others. In different ways, repeating over and over, which is what humans are really good at. Hundreds of years, thousands of years, while human are still endlessly squabbling about these things, the heart of the scorpion has been beating for millions of years, and Mount Augustus has been standing for hundreds of millions of years. They don’t care about what I think or what you do.\n\n\n\nWhat does time ever mean to plants?"

    "text": "Was it my choice, or my fate?\nI grew up in urban cities, but it did not keep me away from nature. Tamagawa (多摩川), a river that flows through Tokyo, shaped my first memories of nature. I have been interested in natural science since then. Yet, my four years in Schwerin had the most impact on my career choice. Schwerin was a small town surrounded by lakes, with nature within walking distance. I spent a lot of time wandering through the nature park and forests with my camera, which gradually drew me into this fantastic field. Birds, with their high mobility and integrated lifestyle with humans, became my favorite. Besides their freedom of flight, which I dreamed of at countless moments, I was also attracted to their elegance and intelligence.\n\n\n\nSeagull breeding its kid\n\n\nAnother passion of mine lies in the ocean. The magical power of the ocean has attracted me in so many ways, too many to sort through. It feels like a born instinct how the sounds of waves, the blue of the depths, and the twinkling of the water trigger my emotions and actions.\nI love thinking, sometimes even a bit too much. I have lost count of how many times I sat on the rocks, looking at the starlight’s reflection in the great lake of Schwerin, thinking about how vastly wide the universe is, and how insanely long time flows. Every time I think about this, I am amazed by the complexity of life, which blooms so brightly and desperately in the eye of Laplace’s demon.\n\nAll of this, and much more, have ultimately led me on the path of becoming a biologist."

    "text": "University\nI started my degree program in 2020 at Universität Hamburg and received my bachelor’s degree at 2024. Currently, I am further pursuing my master degree.\nBesides the basic modules obligatory for everyone studying biology, I attended various elective courses during my bachelor and master studies. Many of them have already paid off with knowledge and skills later on, and some have meaningfully shaped my current specialization.\n\nMolecular Biology\nLike many others, I thought about how my studies could support my future. The first time I stood at the crossroads, molecular biology, or specifically, biotechnology, seemed the most promising. But as I delved deeper, I noticed my lack of constant passion for the technology. They mean more as techniques and methods to me, not as research itself. I needed something more “biological” to immerse myself in. For the first time, I felt eager to answer questions at the front line of research. The questions which are confusing researchers, but also reveal the beauty of life. At the meantime, I had some new experience outside the lab, which reminded me on my original passion. This has made me decide that I don’t want to commit myself to a career that is totally inside the lab, but to take advantage of my knowledge and skills gained in this field to support my career that combines molecular biology with something else.\n\n\nThe first HiWi\nAll I have now, and who I have become, could never have been possible if I hadn’t sent that email back in 2022. It was the second time I saw the hiring ad for a student assistant. The professors in our department hire students yearly to assist with bachelor basic courses, particularly Animal Physiology in my case. Since these courses are mandatory, the number of attendees is high. In the first normal year after COVID, they faced a shortage of hands. Many others, who might have considered the job, were worried about whether they could be up to it, like I was. But seeing the ad twice?\n\n“Well, maybe my German is not good enough, maybe I didn’t have the best grade in that course, but why not give it a try?”\n\nI took it as a reminder of my fate and the last chance to get on that ride. And this, my friend, changed my life. Or anyway, my life would have to change at some point, but with this decision, I held the opportunity tight in my hand, even if I did not realize it back then.\nIt turned out the three-week job went very well. I had a good time and learned a lot, even though I was the one teaching others. This experience helped me overcome my anxiety in front of people, taught me the joy of helping others, and provided me with my first network in my career - with my future thesis supervisor, Dr. Kim Rohlfing.\n\n\nBachelor thesis\nKim was a very talkative and passionate person. During the week we led the course together, she told me a lot about the research group she was in, the elective courses they offered, and their research. I must admit, my first choice for the thesis was another group, but eventually, I asked Kim for an opportunity. At that point, I was still planning to build my career path toward molecular technology.\nThe research group was called “Molecular Evolutionary Biology” and run by Prof. Dr. Susanne Dobler, who taught the fundamental evolution course. I was assigned a fascinating topic about Wolbachia, a stunning bacteria in many insects with impressive witchcraft — manipulating the host’s reproduction behavior, and more. The deeper I dived into it, the more amazed I was. Researchers worldwide have dedicated decades to studying this bacteria, and even more are joining, but still, it is shrouded in mysteries, and this excited me. \nEventually, I have come to realize that evolution was exactly what caught me on this path in the first place. I learned about the basic concept of modern evolutionary theory when I was young, and since then, I have always tried to explain things with it. That’s also how I explained the universe to myself and why the universe amazes me every time. And the topic I dived into, not only Wolbachia but the research on things we don’t know about countless lives on this planet, i.e. the biodiversity, how it works, how it was shaped, and where it will go, the complexity of life, is exactly the radiant flower that dazzles Laplace’s demon.\nThe year in the research group was the most precious year I had during the program. I even had the opportunity to attend an academic conference, the DZG (German Zoological Society) annual meeting in Kassel as an undergraduate student. As I wrote in the acknowledgments of my thesis, I can’t express enough gratitude to Kim, my supervisor, who offered the opportunities in the first place; to Susanne, our group leader, for showing me how an honored researcher should be; to Mario Röpcke, a fellow PhD student in the group, and to Dr. Shabnam Mohammadi, for the various help they offered during the year. I will treasure this memory for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\nMe and my poster\n\n\n\n\nGoing Further\nWith my passion for evolution clarified, my goal became clear. Evolution does not stand alone; it is nothing more than ecology and genetics in relation to time. With that in mind, I began my master’s program and attended two courses - Evolutionary Systematics and Community Ecology. The former strengthened my understanding of evolution. As the course ended, I wrote this text in my notes:\n\nThis course has given me the tools to see the driving forces behind the universe. I’ve come to understand that evolution is not just about the historical development of species. Rather, it’s like an invisible hand from time itself, shaping our world.\n\nThe other one, Community Ecology, finally knitted a network between evolution and ecology for me by showing me how they interact with each other, and clarified how the conservation strategy works. Upon that, it also ‘officially’ connected data science with my career, by teaching us to deal with complex ecological data."

    "text": "Data Science - The Parallel\nThe importance of data science is nowadays no longer a news. I had a slight interest in it since a few years ago, and actually, my fourth preference when applying the university was data science (you can guess my third, it was not related to biology either). Although I am totally happy that I got accepted by B.Sc. biology program at UHH the day after my application, but the interest has remained. The bachelor biology program was reformed after two years after I started, where four semesters of data science course were brought into program to teach students R and be able to utilize digital methods to conduct basic statistical analysis. My program did not have that, we even brought F-table into exam to do some hand-made ANOVA.\nBut I got lucky, I chose to start taking elective course earlier than suggested and replaced the basic biostatistics module with Data Analysis in Ecology (with R) (what I mean by ‘replace’ was actually skipping the basic module because the attendance was not checked). That was where I learned R and was introduced to the world of reproducible research.\nEven if I hadn’t taken course back then, I guess I would have still learned R at some point. As our lecturer suggested, I have used R regularly since then, including in my thesis and the Community Ecology course. I love the feeling of searching for new results in the sea of data, it’s like a magical power that can find peace in a chaotic world. This evoked more interest inside me, such as building this website. Despite all the convenient features provided by Quarto, it still requires a certain level of project management skill to keep everythings clean, tidy, and understandable.\nEarlier this year, I had some time without university courses, I used it to attend courses on Coursera, where many universities offer various courses. I introduced myself to bioinformatics, from simple motif finding to genome assembly, further to sequence comparison and ultimately to big data, in hope that I will use this knowledge in my future career (I’m sure I will)."

    "section": "Bayesian Workflow",
    "text": "Bayesian Workflow\n\nBayesian theorem\nVan De Schoot et al. (2021) described the foundational idea of the Bayesian statistics as follows:\nBayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution.\nThis means we make an initial estimation of our parameters (prior distribution), then observe data and update the model (posterior distribution). Bayes’ theorem, which this approach is based on, is mathematically stated as following:\n\\[\nP(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are events and \\(P(B)\\neq 0\\),\n\\(P(A|B)\\): the probability of event \\(A\\) occurring given that \\(B\\) is true. It is also called the posterior probability (briefly posterior) of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\).\n\\(P(B|A)\\) is also a conditional probability: the probability of event \\(B\\) occurring given that \\(A\\) is true. It can also be interpreted as the likelihood of \\(A\\) given a fixed \\(B\\) because \\(P(B|A)=L(A|B)\\). (\\(L\\): likelihood function)\n\\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) are the probabilities of observing \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the prior probability and marginal probability.\n\n\n\nWhy Bayesian Statistics?\nBayesian statistics is a different framework and approach on statistical analysis. Both classical and Bayesian inference, while trying to model data, have own advantages and disadvantages. Bayesian inference is generally employed whenever uncertainty comes into play:\n\nThere is also a practical advantage of the Bayesian approach, which is that all its inferences are probabilistic and thus can be represented by random simulations. For this reason, whenever we want to summarize uncertainty in estimation beyond simple confidence intervals, and whenever we want to use regression models for predictions, we go Bayesian.\n― Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2024), P. 16\n\nSwanson et al. (2015) pointed out a viewpoint from the traditional niche overlap analysis that might introduce problems: the geometric approach doesn’t account for uncertainty and also lacks direction. This is well illustrated by Fig. 1 in the publication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison between geometric and probabilistic isotope overlap metrics. Isotope x is distributed in species A and B (x-axis); dashed lines show means. The 95% niche region (solid lines) of B is completely contained within that of A, such that the geometric overlap of B onto A is 100%. However, the probability that a randomly chosen member from A falls into the isotopic niche of B is only 35%. (Swanson et al. 2015)\n\n\n\nBy inviting the variance of the niche probability distribution, it now also differentiates the overlap in directions, which means the probability of a species A falling into species B’s niche is not equal to that of species B falling into species A’s niche. Since this perspective starts to consider probability in the models, a Bayesian workflow will provide more reliable and robust analysis.\n\n\nRandom Vector and Multivariate Normal Distribution\nGiven an individual statistical unit, in our case, the niche described by three isotope ratios, a random vector is a group of variables that describes this mathematical system. Which is again, in our case, the three values of the isotope ratio. The distribution of each component of the random vector together forms a multivariate distribution.\nWhen dealing with univariate (one-dimensional) analysis, we often assume that the variable is normally distributed. We do likewise even with multivariate analysis. The multivariate normal distribution is a generalization of the univariate normal distribution into higher dimensions, but it’s not as simple as all components of the random vector being normal. It also requires every linear combination of arbitrary two components in the system to be normally distributed (bivariate normal distribution), which is not always true even if every single variable is normal on its own. This is where the covariance matrix comes into play. Normal distribution is described by two variables: mean and standard deviation (sd), with the latter being simply the square root of the variance.\n\n\nCovariance and covariance matrix\nCovariance is a measure of the joint variability of two variables. The sign of the covariance shows the tendency, i.e. one of the three possible linear relationships between two variables, which are:\n\nnegative linear relationship, covariance is &lt; 0\nno linear relationship, covariance is around 0\npositive linear relationship, covariance is &gt; 0\n\nThe variance is a special case of covariance in which the two variables are identical. Covariance itself is sensitive to the scale of the data, and it does not provide information of on the extent to which the two variables correlate with each other and how well the linear correlation fits the data. All these characteristics make covariance difficult to interpret, but it has become an important stepping stone for many subsequent analysis, such as PCA, correlation analysis, etc.\nA covariance matrix is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements, which is always symmetric, and the diagonal elements represent the variance of each variable. The covariance matrix describes the joint behavior of every linear combination of two variables, analogue to univariate normal distribution, a covariance matrix (\\(\\Sigma\\)) and a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) are used to described a multivariate normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about covariance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatQuest on YouTube (simply and clearly explained)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjugate Prior\nJackson et al. (2011) suggested that the normal distribution is generally appropriate when dealing with stable isotope ratios, and this gives us a way to simplify the analysis by taking advantage of the conjugate prior.\nA conjungate prior is a certain prior distribution that, when applied to a certain likelihood function, results in a posterior distribution from the same distribution family. For example, in univaraite analysis, a normal prior and a normal likelihood function results a normal posterior. In our case, the conjugate prior for the multivariate normal is the normal-inverse-wishart (NIW) distribution. It can be considered in two parts: the mean follows a normal distribution and the covariance follows an inverse-Wishart distribution. NIW is commonly used as the prior distribution when modeling a multivariate normal distribution where the means and the covariances are unknown.\n\n\nThe probability of a random observation of a isotope ratio (\\(x\\)) belongs to species \\(s\\) is following a normal distribution.\n\\[\nP(x |\\text{species}=s) \\backsim N(\\mu_s \\, , \\Sigma_s)\n\\]"

There is a difference to spot between plots using 95% or 99% of the niche region.\n\nnsamples &lt;- 1000\nfish.par &lt;- tapply(1:nrow(fish), fish$species,\n            function(ii) niw.post(nsamples = nsamples, X = fish[ii,2:4]))\n\n# 95% niche region\nover.stat95 &lt;- overlap(fish.par, nreps = nsamples, nprob = 1000, alpha = 0.95)\noverlap.plot(over.stat95, col = clrs, mean.cred.col = \"#024873\", equal.axis = TRUE, xlab = \"Overlap Probability (%) -- Niche Region Size: 95%\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Niche overlap using 95% of the niche region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 99% niche region\nover.stat99 &lt;- overlap(fish.par, nreps = nsamples, nprob = 1000, alpha = 0.99)\noverlap.plot(over.stat99, col = clrs, mean.cred.col = \"#024873\", equal.axis = TRUE, xlab = \"Overlap Probability (%) -- Niche Region Size: 99%\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Niche overlap using 99% of the niche region.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy printing out the returned value from overlap(), numeric results can also be shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee detailed results\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could calculate the estimation for both alpha = 0.99 and 0.95 at the same time.\n\nover.stat.2lvl &lt;- overlap(fish.par, nreps = nsamples, nprob = 1000, alpha = c(0.95, 0.99))\nover.mean.2lvl &lt;- apply(over.stat.2lvl, c(1:2, 4), mean)*100\n\n# Here are the mean of each overlap probability distribution\nround(over.mean.2lvl, 2)\n\n, , alpha = 95%\n\n         Species B\nSpecies A  ARCS  BDWF  LKWF  LSCS\n     ARCS    NA 10.64 65.25 80.95\n     BDWF  0.31    NA 25.72  4.50\n     LKWF  7.35 78.18    NA 52.68\n     LSCS 37.77 51.57 88.46    NA\n\n, , alpha = 99%\n\n         Species B\nSpecies A  ARCS  BDWF  LKWF  LSCS\n     ARCS    NA 32.33 86.64 91.71\n     BDWF  0.79    NA 41.23  8.93\n     LKWF 11.64 92.30    NA 70.00\n     LSCS 50.48 80.34 97.02    NA\n\n\n\n# Here are the upper and lower bounds of the 95% credible interval\nover.cred &lt;- apply(over.stat.2lvl*100, c(1:2, 4), quantile, prob = c(.025, .975), na.rm = TRUE)\nround(over.cred)\n\n, , Species B = ARCS, alpha = 95%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    NA    0    3   27\n  97.5%   NA    1   12   49\n\n, , Species B = BDWF, alpha = 95%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%     1   NA   61   25\n  97.5%   29   NA   92   79\n\n, , Species B = LKWF, alpha = 95%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    38   15   NA   75\n  97.5%   88   37   NA   97\n\n, , Species B = LSCS, alpha = 95%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    66    2   38   NA\n  97.5%   93    8   69   NA\n\n, , Species B = ARCS, alpha = 99%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    NA    0    6   39\n  97.5%   NA    2   18   64\n\n, , Species B = BDWF, alpha = 99%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%     9   NA   80   55\n  97.5%   65   NA   99   97\n\n, , Species B = LKWF, alpha = 99%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    66   27   NA   91\n  97.5%   98   55   NA  100\n\n, , Species B = LSCS, alpha = 99%\n\n       Species A\n        ARCS BDWF LKWF LSCS\n  2.5%    82    4   55   NA\n  97.5%   98   15   85   NA"

The overlap in niche region defined by this data subset (Figure 10) shows, however, different results than those which only utilized isotope signatures (Figure 8). The overlap in all groups and directions between P. papua and P. adeliae is gone, suggesting that their diets have similar \\(\\delta ^{13} C\\) and \\(\\delta ^{15} N\\) signatures, but the prey is probably not the same, since they evolved different functional traits in bill structure. This is more obvious in Figure 9, there is no overlap in niche region described by culmen depth and length between the two species.\nOn the other hand, female individuals of P. antarcticus remain the only group which has a notable overlap with other groups, namely both sexes of P. adeliae. Gorman, Williams, and Fraser (2014), who conducted the study utilizing this data, suggested, regarding their \\(\\delta ^{15} N\\) signature, that the female P. antarcticus might rely more on a certain type of prey, which might then overlap with P. adeliea’s menu. This might also be a reason for the decreased breeding success.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Percentage of breed pair which completed the whole clutch (i.e. 2 eggs for Pygoscelis species)\n\n\nclutch &lt;- comp.penguin %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise(complete_clutch = round(sum(Clutch.Completion == \"Yes\")/sum(!is.na(Clutch.Completion))*100, 2))\nclutch\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Species        complete_clutch\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 P. adeliae                90.6\n2 P. antarcticus            79.1\n3 P. papua                  94.1\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at last, these are our adorable guests:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. adeliae by Dylan Shaw on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. papua by Australian Antarctic Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. antarcticus by Andrew Shiva on Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, if anyone ever wondered – yes, this is the exact same dataset they used to produce the palmerpenguins package. I found the data at EDI Data Portal and didn’t notice until I attached the images, because these three guys showing up at the same time is weirdly familiar to me. The dataset is therefore available by simply attaching the package. If you are interested in what more detailed results people have found with these data, you should check the paper from Gorman, Williams, and Fraser (2014).\n\n\n\nSurprise!"

    "text": "Biological Meaning\nData on niches can be used to:\n\nMake comparisons of the composition and organization of communities.\nExamine shifts in the behavior or ecology of one species in response to another species.\n\nNiche shifts are commonly used to study interspecific competition (see Gause’s Principle of Competitive Exclusion)\n\n\n\nHutchingson’s model of niche as a “hypervolume”\nNiches can be described or defined by relating fitness or utilization to environmental variable (abiotic and biotic).\n\nA range, given the conditions are defined by many axes, which defines the set of conditions under which the animal can survive and reproduce.\nWe can easily illustrate a niche described by up to 3 variables (3-D space), but for fourth axes and onward, the result becomes a hypervolume.\n\nBe aware:\n\nnot all niche axes are environmental - some niche axes are behaviroal (e.g. noctural vs. diurnal)\nnot all axes can be ordered linearly (e.g. types of antipredator behavior)\n\n\n\nFundamental niche vs Realized niche\n\nFundamental niche (FN) is the entire set of conditions under which an animal (a population, a species) can survive and reproduce.\nRealized niche (RN) is the set of condition actually used by given animal (a population, a species) after interactions with other species have been taken into account.\nFN ≥ RN\nRN may differ in populations, because of differences in competitors and predators.\n\n\n\nNiche breadth\n\nSpecialists have narrow niches, generalists have broad niches. These are however relative terms.\nDescribes the endpoints of continuous variation in the degree of specialization in resource use, behavior, and physiology.\n\n\n(levins1966?) - Niche breadth quantification\n\\[B = \\frac{1}{\\sum{p_i^2}}\\]\n\n\\(p_i\\) = proportion of individuals that use resource \\(i\\)\nSpecies that use many resources will have large value of \\(B\\), reflecting a generalist pattern of resource use.\n\n\n\nBetween or within phenotypes\n\nGiven known niche breadth of a population, it is however not necessarily clear how individuals within population use resources. There are possibly two patterns:\n\nAll individuals use entire niche of population, within-phenotype component of niche breadth is large\nEach individuals uses a narrow part of population’s niche, between-phenotype component of niche breadth is large.\n\nIndividual’s niches may change dramatically during lifetime (e.g. metamorphosis, tadpoles are herbivores, frogs are carnivores)\n\n\n\n\nNiche overlap\n\nTypes of overlap\n\nCoextensive, included, reciprocal overlap, asymmetric overlap\nNon-overlapping: abutting, disjunct\n\n\n\n\n(creel2021?)\n\n\n\n\n(jacobs1974?) - Electivity index\nElectivity indices measure the utilization of food types in relation to their abundance or availability in the environment (lechowicz1982?).\n\\[ D = \\frac{r-p}{r+p-2rp}\n\\]\n\n\\(R\\): proportion of item used; \\(P\\): proportion of item available.\nModified from forage ratio and Ivlev’s index (1961), Fig. 12 in (jacobs1974?).\nJacob’s index is independent of the relative abundance of food types in the environment.\nAlso purposing \\(log Q\\) index, both should be tested when a relation is studied between food selection and variables such as the relative abundance of food, light conditions, etc.\nRanges from -1 to 1, where 0 as separator of positive or negative selection.\n\n\n\n(pianka1973?) - Pianka’s niche overlap index\nModification of one presented in MacArthur & Levins (1967).\n\\[ O_{kj} = \\frac{\\sum p_{ij}p_{ik}}{\\sqrt{\\sum p^2_{ij}\\sum p^2_{ik}}}\n\\]\nThis formula is symmetric, i.e. \\(O_{jk} = O_{kj}\\) - \\(P\\): proportion of item \\(i\\) used in relation to the total of items used by species \\(j/k\\).\n\n\n(winemiller1990?) - Randomization algorithm\nWhile testing for the statistical significance related to niche overlap, the major challenge is that the null model is unknown, the niche overlaps are dependent on each party of the interactions. Thus as (winemiller1990?) explained, the standard statistical tests cannot be applied to comparisons involving three or more species. To bypass this, an idea is to generate the null model from the limited data we can collect:\n\n… generate different replicates of a randomized real system (i.e. pseudo-community, the null model) that can be constructed for comparison with an observed prototype.\nIf say, 95 or 99 of 100 randomized pseudo-communities have mean niche overlaps greater than the observed, results are significant at the P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01 level, respectively.\n\nSuch significance indicates that:\n\nObserved community exhibits a non-random pattern of resource utilization.\nSpecies in observed community are utilizing resources in a way that minimized competition.\nEvidence of niche differentiation or resource partitioning among the species in community.\nEvidence for competitive interactions shaping community structure or for past evolutionary adaptations.\n\n4 different algorithm:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelaxed niche breadth(Sum value is redistributed)\nRetained niche breadth(Values are shuffled, but not redistributed)\n\n\n\n\nZeros eliminated(categories with 0 are also reassigned with value)\nRA1\nRA3\n\n\nZeros retained(categories with 0 are reassigned)\nRA2\nRA4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of niches to examine distribution and abundance of species\nSee (creel2021?) for examples.\nList of terms:\n\nInterspecific and intraspecific competition\nNiche expansion, niche contraction\nCompetitive exclusion\nCharacter displacement\nGhost of Competition Past\nTranslocation experiments"

Such gaps are everywhere, especially after I started my master program.\nResearch is more like a process of self-teaching. More and more online resources are available as complement of conventional literature, but I found some of them lack clear introduction, or even proper documentation (R packages without vignette and only have few sentences in description are really bad).
